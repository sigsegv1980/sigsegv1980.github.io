        <h2>Background</h2>
        <br>
        5 members of the <b>Proud Boys</b> were 
        <a href="https://sigsegv1980.github.io/j6/2022-06-06-USAvEthanNordeanAndJosephBiggsAndZacharyRehlAndEnriqueTarrioAndDominicPezzola-ThirdSupersedingIndictment.pdf">
        charged with <b>seditious conspiracy</b></a> for their role in the January 6, 2021 attack on the US Capitol building. 
        Prosecutors claimed that <b>Enrique Tarrio</b>, the leader and chairman of the Proud Boys at the time, conspired
        with <b>Ethan Nordean</b>, <b>Joseph Biggs</b>, <b>Zachary Rehl</b>, and <b>Dominic Pezzola</b>, to storm the
        US Capitol building for the purpose of overturning the 2020 election results, by riling up a large crowd of "normie"
        pro-Trump protesters and using them as a battering ram to breach police defensive lines and occupy the Capitol
        building. The defense acknowledged that some <b>Proud Boys</b> participated in the Capitol riot on January 6, but denied 
        that the defendants actually <i>planned</i> in advance of January 6 to storm the Capitol.
        <br><br>
        The evidence presented by the prosecution to support the <b>seditious conspiracy</b> charges included video footage
        from January 6, but focused primarily around online activity (mostly Telegram and Parler posts) demonstrating
        that the Proud Boys made statements that could be interpreted as incriminating evidence of planning
        in advance to storm the Capitol. 
        The prosecution filed <b><a href="https://sigsegv1980.github.io/j6/2022-06-06-USAvEthanNordeanAndJosephBiggsAndZacharyRehlAndEnriqueTarrioAndDominicPezzola-ThirdSupersedingIndictment.pdf">
        an indictment</a></b> against the 5 Proud Boy conspirators that lists
        Telegram and Parler messages prosecutors believe best support the <b>seditious conspiracy</b> charges. 
        All of the defendants, except <b>Dominic Pezzola</b>, were found guilty
        of <b>seditious conspiracy</b> and 
        <a href="https://sigsegv1980.github.io/j6/2023-09-15-USAvEnriqueTarrio-Judgment.pdf">sentenced to at least <b>15 years</b></a> in prison.
        Here,
        I list all of the incriminating Telegram and Parler messages quoted in 
        <a href="https://sigsegv1980.github.io/j6/2022-06-06-USAvEthanNordeanAndJosephBiggsAndZacharyRehlAndEnriqueTarrioAndDominicPezzola-ThirdSupersedingIndictment.pdf"><b>the indictment</b>
        </a> (along with
        some others that came up during the trial) and analyze each message.
        <br><br>
        I take the position that the <b>seditious conspiracy</b> charges were <b><i>largely baseless</i></b>, and <b>all 5 defendants should
        have been acquitted</b> of that charge due to reasonable doubt. There is no doubt the Proud Boys participated in the
        Capitol riots on January 6 and <a href="#anc37"><i>enthusiastically</i> supported and praised</a> the Jan 6 rioters. But the prosecution's 
        evidence that the Proud Boys actually <b><i>planned in advance</i></b> to storm the Capitol is incredibly
        weak and unconvincing. Throughout
        thousands of Telegram messages in evidence, there are <b>zero</b> references to any such plan 
        and <b>zero</b> discussions about the details of such a plan. That is,
        there are <b>NO</b> Telegram messages where a Proud Boy says something like <i>“Okay guys, so this is how we're
        going to storm the Capitol. First, Team A will be positioned at location X, and Team B will be positioned
        at location Y. Both teams will wait for the signal, etc...”</i>. Rather, there are
        a handful of non-sequitur references to the Capitol building that, out of context, <i>might</i> appear incriminating
        to some people, along with vague references to <i>some</i> kind of plan with no specific details. This is especially
        problematic for the prosecution, because the Proud Boys often discussed
        <i>other</i> incriminating topics in private Telegram group chats they believed at
        the time to be secure. The only evidence even <i>vaguely resembling</i> an actual detailed plan to storm the Capitol
        is the mysterious <i><b>“1776 Returns”</b></i> document, which, <a href="#anc17">as discussed below</a>, turns out to be largely irrelevant 
        to this case.
        <br><br>
        The majority of the Telegram messages included in 
        <a href="https://sigsegv1980.github.io/j6/2022-06-06-USAvEthanNordeanAndJosephBiggsAndZacharyRehlAndEnriqueTarrioAndDominicPezzola-ThirdSupersedingIndictment.pdf"><b>the indictment</b></a>
        demonstrate only that the <b>Proud Boys</b> believed the 2020 election was stolen and often posted
        vague threats of non-specific future violence (e.g. <b>Joseph Biggs</b> 
        <a href="#anc1">saying things like</a> <i>“It's time for fucking War
        if they steal this shit”</i>). This evidence arguably demonstrates that the defendants are 
        potentially dangerous people who supported the Jan 6 rioters <i>after</i> the Capitol riot began, <b><i>not</i></b> that they actually 
        <i>orchestrated</i> the riot or planned in advance to storm the Capitol.
        There is also a large body of <a href="ProudBoys-ExculpatoryChats.html"><b>exculpatory evidence</b></a> (evidence supporting a <i><b>not guilty</b></i> verdict) that must be evaluated 
        alongside the <b>incriminating evidence</b>

        <h2>Sources Of Evidence (so you can reach your own conclusion)</h2>
        <br>
        The prosecution's evidence mostly centered around Telegram and Parler messages from the defendants, particularly the Telegram messages
        from private chat groups affiliated with a chapter of the <b>Proud Boys</b> called <b><i>“The Ministry of Self Defense” (MOSD)</b></i>. As an organization,
        the <b>Proud Boys</b> (<a href="https://sigsegv1980.github.io/j6/ProudBoysConstitutionAndBylaws.pdf">Proud Boys International, L.L.C.</a>)
        were divided into several <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20201126161545/https://proudboysusa.com/chapters/">autonomous regional chapters</a>, 
        loosely governed by Chairman <b>Enrique Tarrio</b>. In December of 2020,
        <b>Enrique Tarrio</b> created <b>“The Ministry of Self Defense”</b> as a new, <i>national-level</i> chapter 
        for organizing national events. The prosecution argued that <b>Tarrio</b> established the <b>MOSD</b> chapter specifically for the purpose
        of planning the January 6 insurrection. Therefore, the majority of the prosecution's
        evidence consists of messages pulled from multiple private Telegram chat groups affiliated with the <b>MOSD</b> chapter of the Proud Boys.
        <br><br>
        Most of the relevant evidence is available publicly. Some of it can be found in
        the <b>Government Exhibits</b> filed electronically with <a href="https://pacer.uscourts.gov/"><b>PACER</b></a>, which I have organized into  
        separate PDF files for each Telegram group (linked below). The
        Telegram evidence from Government Exhibits usually consists of excerpts selected by the prosecution that omit most of the surrounding context.
        Fortunately, we also have a more complete record of some Telegram groups thanks to 
        <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20220827161137/https://t.me/helpstophate/5468"><b><i>leaked documents</i></b></a> (authenticated
        by the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20220708221152/https://www.seattletimes.com/seattle-news/times-watchdog/seattle-proud-boy-reveals-he-was-in-chapter-alleged-to-have-planned-jan-6-insurrection/">Seattle Times</a>) containing
        the Telegram chat history recovered by the FBI using forensic software called <a href="https://cellebrite.com/en/home/"><b>Cellebrite</b></a>. Finally, 
        I have also personally recovered 
        a nearly complete chat history of one of the private <b>MOSD</b> chat groups (<a href="https://sigsegv1980.github.io/j6/ProudBoys-ExportedTelegramChatMOSDOp/messages.html"><b>MOSD Ops</b></a>)

                Included in the indictment to establish that <b>Joe Biggs</b>, and by extension the Proud Boys as a group,
                was angry about the outcome of the 2020 Presidential election, believing that it was
                stolen. This is clearly meant to establish motive and state of mind, but arguably has little
                relevance to the conspiracy charges. <b>Joe Biggs</b> and the other Proud Boys were certainly unhappy with the outcome of the 2020 election 
                and sometimes expressed this anger with threats of non-specific violence. But that does not demonstrate that the 
                Proud Boys devised a plan <i>in advance</i> of January 6th to storm the US Capitol building.
                <b>Joe Biggs'</b> belligerent Parler post is <i>equally as compatible</i> with a <i>spontaneous</i>, unplanned riot as it is with a formal conspiracy
                devised in advance of January 6th.

                The indictment omits the part of <b>Joe Biggs'</b> post that grounds his threat of <i>“fucking war”</i> in a more specific
                historical context. <b>Biggs</b> was likely referring to media reports at the time from conservative outlets (whether “fake news” or not) claiming 
                that Republican election monitors 
                were blocked from effectively monitoring the vote count in certain locales.

                The indictment omits the original context. <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20201223030510/https://parler.com/post/5fc7afc012ca42169403b0b1de20c308"><b>Enrique Tarrio's</b> 
                Parler 
                post</a> was responding to <a href="https://archive.ph/AGVqZ">a tweet from <b>@Javiercousteau</b></a>
                (see <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20201106035714/https://twitter.com/javiercousteau/status/1324561454893326339">archive.org version</a>, 
                this user goes by <a href="https://x.com/doubleccousteau/status/1324561454893326339">@doubleccoustea</a> as of 2025). The tweet made the absurd,
                histrionic claim
                that <i>“[Proud Boys in DC are] approaching black people with handcuffs and threatening to kidnap folk”</i> and suggested
                that “<i>KILL FIRST ASK LATER</i>” would have been an appropriate counter-measure against the Proud Boys. 
                <b>Enrique Tarrio's</b> post is meant to ironically
                juxtapose the media's focus on the Proud Boys' violent behavior with violent rhetoric coming from a political 
                enemy of the Proud Boys, presumably to highlight what <b>Tarrio</b> saw as bias or hypocrisy in the media.

                Included in the indictment to suggest to the reader that <b>Enrique Tarrio</b> (and by extension the Proud Boys as a group) was 
                a political extremist with no interest in peace 
                nor compromise. This is of course meant to establish motive or state of mind, but it arguably has little relevance to the conspiracy charges. 
                <b>Enrique Tarrio</b> was certainly unhappy with the outcome of the 2020 election and he sometimes expressed this unhappiness with vaguely violent 
                or threatening rhetoric. But
                that does not demonstrate that the Proud Boys devised a plan <i>in advance</i> of January 6th to storm the US Capitol building.
                <br><br>
                Moreover, the indictment omits the original context of <b>Tarrio's</b> Parler post, wherein he was replying to an
                <i>earlier</i> post from Parler user <b>@LisaMarieBoothe</b> that said <i>“I don’t want unity. I want to work to defeat Democrats in 
                the upcoming elections.”</i> <b>Tarrio</b> expressed agreement with this sentiment using somewhat colorful language (<i>“fuck unity ... no quarter”</i>), but
                the level of implicit violence in <b>Tarrio's</b> reply is <i>negligible</i>. <b>Tarrio's</b> post here is qualitatively <i>indistinguishable</i>
                from typical political discourse on social media, and was probably not even worth including in the indictment.
                <br><br>
                Furthermore, <b>Enrique Tarrio</b> <i>also</i> posted another message on Parler that called for political change via
                <i><b>inspiration</b></i> instead of force or violence. That post included an attached promotional video (a recruitment or PR tool
                for the Proud Boys) that was clearly intended to evoke things like patriotism, sacrifice and brotherhood. The video 
                contained brief footage of violent street-level brawling with counter-protesters, but the music and narration framed this 
                violence as defensive, noble and heroic.

                        nice and by the rules, now you will deal with the monster you created. The spirit of
                        1776 has resurfaced and has created groups like the Proudboys and we will not be
                        extinguished. We will grow like the flame that fuels us and spread like love that
                        guides us. We are unstoppable, unrelenting and now ...unforgiving. Good luck to

                Included in the indictment to suggest that <b>Ethan Nordean</b> (a.k.a. <b>Rufio</b>), and by extension the Proud Boys as a collective, was angry about
                the outcome of the 2020 election, and used incendiary and melodramatic language to communicate an implicit threat of 
                non-specific violence. 
                This is meant to establish motive and state of mind, along with a general willingness to resort to violence, but arguably has little 
                relevance to the conspiracy charges.
                Again, <b>Ethan Nordean's</b> belligerent post is <i>equally as compatible</i> with a <i>spontaneous</i>, 
                unplanned riot as it is with a secret plot to storm the Capitol devised in advance of January 6th.

                Proud Boys needed <i>"to portray a more masculine vibe"</i> that better reflected how the Proud Boys wanted to be perceived. Biggs seemed 
                primarily concerned with how the Proud Boys were <i>perceived</i> publicly, which is appropriate given that

                of "marketing"</a> later that week after the “<b>Ministry of Self Defense</b>” (<b>MOSD</b>) chapter was established. However, the intended

                began to recruit <i>"real men"</i> who were willing to <i>"stand up and fight"</i> (i.e. engage in political violence).

                This Telegram conversation was included in the indictment to demonstrate to the reader that the Proud Boys were focused on the 
                US Capitol building as early as December 20th, 2020, and
                to establish that the Proud Boys were making plans and having Zoom meetings about Jan 6 at that time. 
                <br>
                <br>
                However, like much of the prosecution's evidence, these Telegram posts establish that the Proud Boys were planning <i>something</i>, 
                but provide no information about <i>WHAT</i> the Proud Boys were actually planning. For a typical jury member, or anyone unfamiliar with the
                history of the Proud Boys and the political rallies they attended throughout 2020, it's easy to read these posts and 
                assume (due to basic human <i><b>confirmation bias</b></i>) that
                any discussion about <i>planning</i> for Jan 6, or any mention of the <b>Capitol building</b>, automatically <i>corroborates</i> the prosecution's 
                <b>seditious conspiracy</b> case. 
                After 
                all, what <i>else</i> would the Proud Boys be planning on doing in Washington DC on Jan 6, if not storming the Capitol?
                <br>
                <br>
                But the indictment misleadingly omits significant historical context here that reveals this exchange over Telegram to be nothing more than typical
                <i>event planning</i>. 
                The Proud Boys attended <i>many</i> rallies throughout 2020, most of which were organized by
                conservative activist groups that had obtained 
                <b><i>event permits</i></b>
                to legally hold a rally in some public space.
                In 2020, the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20201231183223/https://stopthesteal.us/">“<b>Stop The Steal</b>” coalition</a>

                Originally, the <i><b>main event</b></i> of the Jan 6 rally was to be a large demonstration in <b>Freedom Plaza</b> (NPS event 
                permit <a href="https://sigsegv1980.github.io/j6/NPS-EventPermitApplication_21-0274.pdf"><b>21-0274</b></a>), but the
                location was later changed to the <b>Ellipse</b>
                (NPS event permit <a href="https://sigsegv1980.github.io/j6/KylieKremer-Jan6PermitForWomenForAmericaFirst-Amended.pdf"><b>21-0278</b></a>) after 
                <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20210103160805/https://twitter.com/realDonaldTrump/status/1345753534168506370">President Trump announced that he would give a speech</a>
                on January 6th.
                However, on December 20th, 2020, when the Telegram conversation between <b>Enrique Tarrio</b> and <b>Johnny Blackbeard</b> occurred, 
                nobody knew that President Trump would be giving a speech on January 6th. Thus, at this early stage,
                the <i><b>main event</b></i> of the Jan 6 rally was to be <a href="https://sigsegv1980.github.io/j6/NPS-EventPermitApplication_21-0274.pdf">located at <b>Freedom Plaza</b></a>
                and various <a href="https://sigsegv1980.github.io/j6/USCapitolPolicePermitsForEventsNearCapitol.pdf">smaller events were to be held at locations near the 
                Capitol building</a>. For example, an organization called “<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20201223181220/https://latinosfortrump.us/"><b>Latinos For Trump</b></a>” 
                had arranged 
                a “<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20221226142306/https://twitter.com/i/web/status/1343360740313321474">YUGE freedom rally</a>”
                to be held at “Area 7” (300 First Street NE) 
                <a href="https://sigsegv1980.github.io/j6/LatinosForTrumpJan6Flyer.pdf">by the Capitol between 10 AM and 12 PM</a> 
                on January 6th, 2021. 
                
                <br><br>
                When the Proud Boys attended a rally like this, their activities typically involved 
                attending the <b>official events</b>, 
                <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20210110164843/https://video.parler.com/uY/Nb/uYNb0PwARkgL_small.mp4">marching through the streets chanting 
                slogans</a>, 
                giving <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20201120085317/https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7H9pQB6bGrU">speeches in front of crowds</a>, 
                and sometimes <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20201115132417/https://weartv.com/news/local/proud-boys-provide-security-at-pro-america-rally-in-milton">providing security</a> 
                for <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20201126081012/https://parler.com/post/e475993d3f834a46acba44a212f4142d">high-profile conservatives</a> and/or 
                <a href="https://x.com/SRodd_CPR/status/1330258072678363143">ordinary pro-Trump protesters</a> attending the rally.
                Thus, when <b>Johnny Blackheard</b>
                asked <b>Enrique Tarrio</b> “<i>what locations do you absolutely need to stop at?</i>”, he was
                thinking about the <i>locations of the <b>official events</b></i> at the Jan 6 rally. 
                Many of these <b>official events</b> — including the <a href="https://sigsegv1980.github.io/j6/LatinosForTrumpJan6Flyer.pdf"><b>Latinos For Trump</b> 
                event</a> — were to be <a href="https://sigsegv1980.github.io/j6/USCapitolPolicePermitsForEventsNearCapitol.pdf">held near the Capitol building</a>,
                which is likely part of the reason <b>Johnny Blackheard</b> assumed that <i>“most of the protest will be at the capital [sic]</i>”.
                (Also, early <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20201223062953/https://wildprotest.com/">promotional materials for the Jan 6 rally</a> 
                implied the Capitol would be the main location.) 
                <br><br>
                In fact, <b>Enrique Tarrio</b> was
                the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20201002154105/https://www.nytimes.com/2020/10/02/us/elections/the-florida-director-of-a-pro-trump-latino-group-is-the-chairman-of-the-proud-boys.html">Florida State Director 
                for <b>Latinos For Trump</b></a> and had arranged for some Proud Boys in his chapter to 
                <a href="https://youtu.be/9HY3IVStIJc?t=3191">provide security
                at the <b>Latinos For Trump</b> event</a> on January 6th. <b>Tarrio</b> would have therefore 
                “<i>absolutely need[ed] to stop</i>” at the <b>Latinos For Trump</b> event stage near the Capitol. 
                It's also very likely that <b>Enrique Tarrio</b> was scheduled to <i><b>give a speech</b></i> on January 6th
                at the <b>Latinos For Trump</b> event stage (see   
                <a href="https://sigsegv1980.github.io/j6/ProudBoys-MOSDChat-2020-12-20_2021-1-4.pdf#page=32"><b>Captain Trump's</b> post in the <b>MOSD Leaders</b> group chat</a>,
                the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20210105023846/https://parler.com/post/99d45bcf635e4e319a4d20774f12831c">Parler post from Loomer</a>,
                and the <a href="https://sigsegv1980.github.io/j6/2023-03-24-USAvProudBoys-TranscriptOfJuryTrial-Day54.pdf#page=63">trial testimony of <b>George Mesa</b></a> and

                <br>
                <br>
                Finally, the indictment also uses misleading language to suggest that <b>Enrique Tarrio</b> setup the Zoom meeting <i>IN RESPONSE</i> to <b>Johnny Blackbeard's</b> 
                statement about the
                Capitol, thereby subtly connecting the Capitol building to whatever the Proud Boys discussed during that Zoom meeting. But <b>Tarrio's</b> response
                came over <i>20 minutes</i> after <b>Johnny Blackbeard's</b> comment about the Capitol, and was actually a response
                to <b>Johnny Blackbeard's</b> <i>earlier 
                question</i> asking where <b>Tarrio</b>
                “<i>absolutely need[s] to stop at</i>” on Jan 6. Indeed, this paragraph of the indictment
                exemplifies a <i>typical</i> pattern repeated throughout the conspiracy trial: the prosecution often
                took a snippet of some <i>innocuous</i> Telegram conversation (often alluding to some kind of “planning” and/or 
                referencing the Capitol building) and framed it as <b><i>incriminating</i></b> evidence of a secret plot
                to storm the Capitol. This <a href="https://www.vice.com/en/article/enrique-tarrio-proud-boys-jury/">proved to be very effective</a>
                due to basic human <b><i>confirmation bias</i></b>.

                Included in the indictment to suggest that the “<b>Ministry of Self Defense</b>” (<b>MOSD</b>) chapter, created by
                Proud Boy chairman <b>Enrique Tarrio</b>, was a strict chapter with a militaristic structure, created mostly 
                for the purpose of planning to storm the US Capitol on Jan 6. The indictment focuses on the rigidly non-democratic 
                nature of the <b>MOSD</b>, exemplified by the catch-phrase <b><i>“fit in or fuck off”</i></b>. 
                <br><br>
                A few examples of <b>Enrique Tarrio</b>
                and other <b>MOSD</b> leaders exhibiting this <i>“fit in or fuck off”</i> attitude are listed in the left column.
                However, the indictment oversells the level of strictness enforced by <b>Tarrio</b> and the <b>MOSD</b> leadership. 
                The <b>MOSD</b> chapter was certainly no
                democracy, as is clear from the

                However, the tone and verbiage used by <b>MOSD</b> leaders <b>Zach Rehl</b> and <b>Enrique Tarrio</b> during the 
                <b><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9HY3IVStIJc">MOSD Zoom meeting</a></b> on December 30, 2020

                The phrase “<b>fit in or fuck off</b>” first appeared on the <b><a href="https://sigsegv1980.github.io/j6/ProudBoys-MOSDMemberApplicationForm.pdf">MOSD 
                Application Form</a></b> that <b>Enrique Tarrio</b> required prospective members to sign before they were permitted to join the <b>MOSD</b> chapter. 
                However, <b>Tarrio</b> only
                actually said this phrase <i>once</i> on Telegram (in the 
                <a href="https://sigsegv1980.github.io/j6/ProudBoys-MOSD-MAIN-FullChatMessages-2020-12-27_2021-1-1.pdf#page=254"><b>MOSD MAIN</b> group chat</a>)
                when another Proud Boy named <b>Brien James</b> 
                <a href="https://sigsegv1980.github.io/j6/ProudBoys-MOSD-MAIN-FullChatMessages-2020-12-27_2021-1-1.pdf#page=251">criticized the structure of the <b>MOSD</b> chapter</a> 
                and disapproved of <b>Joe Biggs</b> being assigned a leadership role. <b>Enrique Tarrio</b>
                told Brien James to <i>“Fit in...or fuck off”</i>. This was really the only occasion (at least on Telegram) where <b>Tarrio</b> strictly enforced
                anything in the <b>MOSD</b> chapter. Also, simply reading through a 
                typical <a href="https://sigsegv1980.github.io/j6/ProudBoys-ExportedTelegramChatMOSDOp/messages.html"><b>MOSD</b> Telegram group chat</a>
                — often filled with silly memes and vulgar jokes — should immediately dispel the notion that the Proud Boys were even <i>capable</i> of being
                particularly serious on a consistent basis.
                <br><br>
                The indictment also obscures the actual purpose of the <b>MOSD</b> chapter and the historical context that prompted its creation. The indictment
                suggests the <b>MOSD</b> was created <i>specifically</i> to pre-plan the attack on the Capitol building. But Telegram chats and the
                <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9HY3IVStIJc"><b>MOSD Zoom meeting video</b></a> make it absolutely clear that the <b>MOSD</b> chapter was 
                created to address serious disciplinary and organizational problems that came to light during the  
                <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20201212160205/https://www.nbcwashington.com/news/local/trump-supporters-maga-rally-protest-dc-saturday/2506267/">previous

                <b>Enrique Tarrio</b> <a href="https://sigsegv1980.github.io/j6/ProudBoys-OfficialPresidentsChat-2020-8-7_2020-12-31.pdf#page=17">

                In the full post,
                <b>Enrique Tarrio</b> said that the <b>MOSD</b> chapter will be running a “<i><b>training exercise</b></i>” during “<i>the 5th at night and 6th throughout the day</i>”.
                This is not particularly compatible with the prosecution's <i>seditious conspiracy</i> case. 
                If the <b>MOSD</b> Proud Boys <b><i>truly</i></b> had plans to storm the Capitol on January 6th, it would have made little
                sense for <b>Enrique Tarrio</b> to declare that the <b>MOSD</b> chapter would be running a <i>“<b>training exercise</b>”</i> on January 6th 
                <i>“<b>throughout the day</b>”</i>.
                However, this is quite consistent with <b>Tarrio's</b> comments during the <b>MOSD Zoom Meeting</b> on December 30th, 2020, when
                he reiterated that the <b>MOSD</b> chapter would use the January 6th rally <i>“<a href="https://youtu.be/9HY3IVStIJc?t=1460"><b>as a training exercise</b></a>”</i>.
                Similarly, in an <a href="https://sigsegv1980.github.io/j6/ProudBoys-MOSD-MAIN-FullChatMessages-2020-12-27_2021-1-1.pdf#page=194">announcement posted 
                in the <b>MOSD MAIN</b> Telegram group chat</a> on December 29th, 2020, <b>Tarrio</b>
                stated that <i>“we are going to be using the 6th <b>as a test</b>”</i>. 
                <br><br>
                Of course, the prosecution claimed that the <b>MOSD</b> chapter was created 
                <i>specifically</i> for the purpose of planning in secret to storm the Capitol building on January 6th, 2021. Moreover, the prosecution also claimed that the
                <b>MOSD</b> Proud Boys' <i>primary objective</i> for the Jan 6 rally was to execute their pre-planned assault on the Capitol. 
                I have argued that the prosecution's claims are incorrect and not supported by the evidence. But if there was no secret conspiracy to
                storm the Capitol, then what was the Proud Boys'
                <b><i>actual</i></b> plan for the Jan 6 rally? The Proud Boys' <a href="https://sigsegv1980.github.io/j6/ProudBoys-EastCoastRallyCommandChat.pdf#page=2"><b>itinerary 
                for an earlier “Stop The Steal” rally</b></a> 
                in December of 2020 provides some insight. Rallies attended by the Proud Boys generally involved 
                a <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20201212171441/https://twitter.com/ShelbyTalcott/status/1337804059085070336"><b>daytime march</b></a>
                through the city streets in accordance with the 
                <a href="https://sigsegv1980.github.io/j6/CindyChafian-December12PermitForWomenForAmericaFirst.pdf">official event permits</a> 
                issued to event organizers. However, the plan for the Jan 6 rally was slightly different.
                <br><br>
                The plan for January 6th was directly related to the creation of the <b>MOSD</b> chapter as a new
                <a href="https://sigsegv1980.github.io/j6/ProudBoys-MOSDProspectsSmall.pdf">national chapter</a>
                for organizing high-profile rallies in DC.
                The <b>MOSD</b> chapter was established as a <i>reaction</i> to the 
                <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20201213043848/https://www.the-sun.com/news/1959359/million-maga-march-dc-trump-steal-election-stabbing/">disastrous
                events of the previous

                with a counter-protester</a>. This debacle
                convinced <b>Enrique Tarrio</b> that many of the “rank and file” Proud Boys
                were much too <a href="https://sigsegv1980.github.io/j6/ProudBoys-OfficialPresidentsChat-2020-8-7_2020-12-31.pdf#page=17">undisciplined</a> and

                and attack random hecklers or counter-protesters on the sidelines. The new <b>MOSD</b> chapter was intended to
                address these issues by establishing a <a href="https://sigsegv1980.github.io/j6/ProudBoys-MOSD-MAIN-FullChatMessages-2020-12-27_2021-1-1.pdf#page=194">stricter

                With this background context in mind, <b>Enrique Tarrio's</b> Telegram post quoted here in the left column 
                provides our first clue as to the <b>MOSD</b> Proud Boys'
                <b><i>actual</i></b> plan for the Jan 6 rally. <b>Tarrio</b> stated that the <b>MOSD</b> Proud Boys would be 
                <i>“<b>running a training exercise</b>”</i> on January 6th <i>“<b>throughout the day</b>”</i>, and in a later post <b>Tarrio</b> 
                further stated that

                        to become more and more unpopular, right, to come to these things without being part of this chapter, at
                        a national level. Obviously, at a local level you guys can do whatever the fuck you want but, um, again I
                        reiterate, like we need to do national events a lot better than what we've, we've been doing in the past.

                    </div>
                </div>

                Thus, when we synthesize <b>Enrique Tarrio's</b> various stated objectives for January 6th, like remaining “<b><i>as a nucleus</i></b>” and 
                staying <b><i>“as one fucking unit”</i></b>, with his other statements describing the agenda for January 6th
                <i>“<a href="https://sigsegv1980.github.io/j6/ProudBoys-MOSD-MAIN-FullChatMessages-2020-12-27_2021-1-1.pdf#page=194"><b>as a test</b></a>”</i>
                involving a <i>“<a href="https://sigsegv1980.github.io/j6/ProudBoys-MOSD-MAIN-FullChatMessages-2020-12-27_2021-1-1.pdf#page=118"><b>training exercise</b></a>”</i>,
                Tarrio's <i><b>TRUE</b></i>
                plan for January 6th becomes pretty clear. <b>Enrique Tarrio</b> wanted to use the January 6 rally 
                to <b><i>field test</i></b> the <b>MOSD</b> chapter — to take it for a spin out in the streets of DC and test the new rallying policies
                and command structure to see if they worked as anticipated. 
                This is also consistent with <b>Charles Donohoe</b>'s
                description of the plan for Jan 6 as 
                <i>“<a href="https://sigsegv1980.github.io/j6/ProudBoys-ExportedTelegramChatMOSDOp/messages.html#go_to_message441"><b>a simple and quick mission</b></a>”</i>.
                The objective was to
                divide the attending <b>MOSD</b> Proud Boys into ten-man squads while maintaining 
                a single overall marching formation (<b><i>“stay as one fucking unit”</i></b> and <b><i>“remain as a nucleus”</i></b>)
                throughout the march. The <a href="https://sigsegv1980.github.io/j6/ProudBoys-MOSD-MAIN-FullChatMessages-2020-12-27_2021-1-1.pdf#page=194">stricter
                <b>MOSD</b> command structure</a> and rallying policies (e.g. <a href="https://youtu.be/9HY3IVStIJc?t=273">banning intoxication</a>) were intended to help leadership
                coordinate the ten-man squads while maintaining a single overall formation like a well-disciplined, professional infantry.
                <br><br>
                Thus, the Proud Boys'
                <b><i>actual</i></b> plan for the Jan 6 rally was similar to the <a href="https://sigsegv1980.github.io/j6/ProudBoys-EastCoastRallyCommandChat.pdf#page=2">itineraries of 
                previous rallies</a> in the sense that it involved s daytime march through the streets. But the plan for Jan 6 was also somewhat different, as instead of the usual daytime march, 
                the <b>MOSD</b> Proud Boys
                would conduct a “<b>trial run</b>” of the new <b>MOSD</b>
                command structure and rallying policies (e.g. <a href="https://youtu.be/9HY3IVStIJc?t=1019">splitting up into smaller squads</a>) to determine
                if these new protocols enabled Proud Boy leaders to better control the “rank and file” while
                staying together <i>“<a href="https://youtu.be/9HY3IVStIJc?t=1460"><b>as one fucking unit</b></a>”</i> and 
                <a href="https://youtu.be/9HY3IVStIJc?t=2209">maintaining formation</a> during the march. 
                Thus, <b>Enrique Tarrio's</b> 
                true plan for Jan 6 was actually
                quite mundane and had absolutely nothing to do with any secret conspiracy to storm the Capitol.
                <br><br>
                Finally, for the
                purpose of conducting the <b>MOSD</b> training exercises during the Jan 6 rally, <b>Tarrio</b> 
                <a href="https://sigsegv1980.github.io/j6/ProudBoys-MOSD-MAIN-FullChatMessages-2020-12-27_2021-1-1.pdf#page=118">divided
                the attending Proud Boys into two groups</a>. <b>Group 1</b> included the Proud Boys 
                <a href="https://sigsegv1980.github.io/j6/ProudBoys-SkullAndBonesChat-2020-9-29_2021-1-4.pdf#page=10">specially selected</a> 
                to be part of the <b>MOSD</b> chapter, while <b>Group 2</b> included all the regional Proud Boy chapters. 
                It's worth noting that even though the members of <b>Group 2</b>
                were mostly autonomous and separate from the <b>MOSD</b> chapter, <b>Tarrio</b> nonetheless ordered members of
                <b>Group 2</b> attending the Jan 6 rally to <i>“<a href="https://sigsegv1980.github.io/j6/ProudBoys-MOSD-MAIN-FullChatMessages-2020-12-27_2021-1-1.pdf#page=118">conduct 
                themselves as gentlemen and always keep themselves in a <b>self defense mindset</b></a>”</i>.
                <br><br>
                This concern with how the Proud Boys are perceived in the eyes of the public is consistent with <b>Enrique Tarrio's</b> 
                fear that if <i>“one huge [public] incident happens”</i> where the Proud Boys are <i>“at fault”</i>
                it could <i>“<a href="https://youtu.be/9HY3IVStIJc?t=463"><b>bury the entire club</b></a>”</i>. That is, <b>Enrique Tarrio</b> 
                feared that undisciplined behavior
                among the Proud Boys' ranks could eventually result in a <b>PR disaster</b>. This level-headed
                concern with public relations hardly seems appropriate for a man who was allegedly planning to attack police 
                and storm the US Capitol building about a week later. The overall takeaway here is that
                a secret conspiracy to storm the Capitol building probably never existed, and the Proud Boys' <b><i>actual</i></b> plan for January 6th
                was much more mundane.

                        be wearing our traditional Black and Yellow. We will be incognito and we will be spread across
                        downtown DC in smaller teams. And who knows ... we might dress in all BLACK for the
                        occasion.” At different times, NORDEAN, BIGGS, REHL, and Donohoe reiterated that Proud
                        Boys members should avoid wearing Proud Boys colors on January 6, 2021.

                        The Washington Post for some reason believed that one of the many hotels we frequent was newsworthy. 
                        Because of this the hotel decided to close for 3 days. A hotel that prides itself with saying they haven’t 
                        closed their doors since it’s open in the 1920s. They have fallen victim to to the fake news. With @TheProudBoys 
                        you can see in real time the media machine do the globalists dirty work. The media is the ENEMY of the 
                        people. We had already stopped using the hotel as a hub 3 months ago. With the new ability I’ve being 
                        able to put 1000 boots on the ground we outgrew any single hotel.

                This Parler post was extremely important to the prosecution's seditious conspiracy case. In a public announcement on Parler,
                <b>Enrique Tarrio</b> informed his thousands of followers that the Proud Boys will
                <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20201229170859/https://parler.com/post/c741b78505a54150bdf63d079952e8f0">not be wearing their traditional
                black and yellow uniforms on January 6</a>, and will instead show up incognito (in plain clothes). Tarrio also suggests that some or
                all of the Proud Boys that show up in D.C. on January 6 will be dressed in all black.
                <br><br>
                Firstly, <b>Enrique Tarrio's</b> statement that the Proud Boys will <i>"spread across downtown DC in smaller teams"</i> is already mostly incompatible
                with the prosecution's <b>seditious conspiracy</b> case, because it's not really clear why spreading out in small teams "across downtown DC"
                makes any sense if the goal is to attack the Capitol building. The indictment glosses over this, focusing on the fact
                that the Proud Boys dressed incognito on Jan 6 instead of <i>"wearing Proud Boys colors that had been prominently displayed at previous events."</i>
                <br><br>
                Jan 6 was <i>not</i> the first time the Proud Boys considered showing up to an event without wearing the traditional
                black and yellow Proud Boy club colors. For example, back in September, 2020, before Trump even lost the election (and thus before
                the Proud Boys would have had any motive to storm the Capitol), one
                Proud Boy, concerned about increased public scrutiny after the Proud Boys were name-dropped on national television, 
                commented in a

                (Govt Exhibit <b>530-2</b>) when attending a rally in North Carolina. Then in December, before

                Clearly, the Proud Boys occasionally had reasons to avoid wearing their usual club colors, even when not involved in any
                seditious conspiracies to storm Capitol buildings. Yet throughout the trial, the prosecution maintained that the Proud Boys dressed incognito on January 6th 
                expressly because
                they planned to storm the Capitol building and wanted to avoid being easily identified. The prosecution lumped 
                the "no colors" policy together with other preparations made by the Proud Boys in advance of Jan 6,
                including the fact that the Proud Boys came to D.C. with protective gear (body armor) and walkie-talkies,
                arguing that all of these preparations were part of a pre-planned conspiracy to attack the Capitol.  
                (See paragraph 28 of <a href="https://sigsegv1980.github.io/j6/2022-06-06-USAvEthanNordeanAndJosephBiggsAndZacharyRehlAndEnriqueTarrioAndDominicPezzola-ThirdSupersedingIndictment.pdf#page=8"><b>the

                    The seditious conspiracy began at least as early as December 19, 2020.
                    Tarrio, Nordean, Biggs, Rehl, and other leaders of the Proud Boys organization intentionally
                    recruited men prepared to engage in physical violence, if necessary. They organized a return to
                    Washington, D.C., which guidance included what to wear (e.g., no colors), what to bring (e.g.,
                    protective gear and communication equipment), and what to do (e.g., fit in or fuck off).

                This is one of the <b><i>least</i></b> defensible claims made by the prosecution. Firstly, the Proud Boys regularly
                <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20210210210521/https://kuow.org/stories/extremist-groups-popping-up-left-and-right-in-pacific-northwest-law-enforcement-officials-say">wore protective gear</a>

                Secondly, there is <i>overwhelming</i> evidence
                that preparations made by the Proud Boys for Jan 6 (including bringing protective gear and not wearing colors) was 
                <b>in anticipation of violent conflict with Antifa</b>, the Proud Boys' long-time street rivals at political rallies and protests.
                The term <b>"Antifa"</b> is an umbrella term referring to various regional <b>anti-fascist</b> or anarchist

                The mischievous, mocking tone of these Parler posts is consistent with the interpretation that <b>Enrique Tarrio</b> and the other Proud Boys
                posted this information <i>publicly</i> on Parler to confuse or intimidate Antifa, perhaps with the goal of ultimately being able
                to <a href="https://sigsegv1980.github.io/j6/ProudBoys-MOSD-Main-2020-12-27_2021-1-4.pdf#page=7">infiltrate or ambush <b>Antifa</b></a>. This 
                interpretation is consistent with the fact that <b>Enrique Tarrio's</b> post
                ends with a cryptic remark, omitted in the indictment: <i>"48 Laws of Power #3 #4 #14 #15 #17 #29 #37 #39 #48"</i>. This is a 
                clear reference to the rules enumerated in <a href="https://www.amazon.com/48-Laws-Power-Robert-Greene/dp/0140280197">Robert Greene’s 48 Laws of Power</a>, 
                including Rule #3: <i>conceal your intentions</i>, Rule #14: <i>pose as a friend, work as a spy</i>, and Rule #17: <i>keep 
                others in suspended terror - cultivate an air of unpredictability.</i>
                <br><br>
                This interpretation is confirmed by the <b><a href="https://youtu.be/9HY3IVStIJc?t=576">December 30th, 2020 MOSD Zoom planning
                meeting</a></b> (see <a href="https://sigsegv1980.github.io/j6/ProudBoys-2020-12-30-MOSDZoomMeetingTranscript.pdf#page=6">full transcript</a>), 
                where <b>Enrique Tarrio</b> explained that the purpose of publicly announcing the "no colors" policy was to conceal the number
                of Proud Boys in D.C. on Jan 6, since Tarrio expected a significantly smaller number of Proud Boys (in comparison with previous D.C. rallies) 
                to attend.

                    time, right, <b>we're not going to have a thousand proud boys on the ground, so we need to appear bigger than

                    </div>
                </div>

                This is consistent with Proud Boy <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20210110193324/https://parler.com/post/4147b18068fd485db7c8fad338792e88"><b>Bill Whicker III's</b> Parler post</a>, 
                where he coyly says <i>"Maybe a few? 
                Maybe a thousand? <b>Antifa will never know.</b> They better think twice about attacking anyone this time. We are everywhere! Or are we?"</i>
                And it's also consistent with <a href="https://sigsegv1980.github.io/j6/ProudBoys-OfficialPresidentsChat-2020-8-7_2020-12-31.pdf#page=23">another 
                statement <b>from</b> Tarrio on Telegram</a> 
                (see Govt Exhibit <b>514-47</b>) where he explains that one purpose of the "no colors" announcement on Parler was to cultivate fear among <b>Antifa</b>.
                And it's further corroborated by a <a href="https://sigsegv1980.github.io/j6/ProudBoys-MOSDChat-2020-12-20_2021-1-4.pdf#page=11">
                statement from <b>Joe Biggs</b> in the <b>MOSD</b> Leaders Telegram group chat</a> (see Govt Exhibit <b>501-12</b>), where he
                asks the other Proud Boys to avoid posting anything on social media prior to Jan 6 that would <i>"give away locations or our numbers"</i>.
                <br><br>
                All of this strongly suggests that the "no colors" policy was meant to enable the Proud Boys to avoid being recognized by <b>Antifa</b> on Jan 6. 
                This is the most natural, straightforward interpretation of the relevant Parler posts. Indeed, after <b>Enrique Tarrio</b> announced the "no colors" policy on Parler, 
                <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20210104151444/https://www.businessinsider.com/proud-boys-attend-january-6-dc-rally-incognito-all-black-2021-1"><b>Business 
                Insider</b> published
                an article</a> about the Proud Boys that simply took it for granted that the purpose of showing up "incognito" on Jan 6 was to blend in with <b>Antifa</b>, since
                this is the most natural interpretation.
                <br><br>
                On top of all this, several posts from the private 
                <a href="https://sigsegv1980.github.io/j6/ProudBoys-ExportedTelegramChatMOSDOp/messages.html"><b>MOSD Ops Telegram chat group</b></a> make it 
                <b><i>indisputably clear</i></b> that the purpose
                of the "no colors"/incognito policy was to avoid being recognized by <b>Antifa</b>. In this chat, the Proud Boys were
                discussing dressing up in all black like <b>Antifa</b>. Some Proud Boys even 
                <a href="https://sigsegv1980.github.io/j6/ProudBoys-ExportedTelegramChatMOSDOp/messages.html#go_to_message386">posted pictures on Telegram</a> 
                showing off their attempts to dress like <b>Antifa</b>
                by donning all-black attire and protective gear. Both <b>Joe Biggs</b> and <b>Enrique Tarrio</b> commented that blending in with <b>Antifa</b>
                convincingly would require certain Proud Boys to <b>hide their beards</b>, because (according to Biggs and Tarrio) <b>Antifa</b> members typically do not have beards:

                <b>These Telegram posts amount to <i>indisputable</i>, “smoking-gun” level evidence that the Proud Boys' purpose in showing up incognito in D.C. on Jan 6
                was to try to blend in with Antifa.</b>
                However, despite all this, the prosecution stubbornly maintained the position that the Proud Boys
                did not wear their normal colors on Jan 6 because they were planning to attack the police and storm the Capitol.

                Finally, there are numerous discussions across multiple Telegram chat groups where the Proud Boys talk about personal protective
                equipment and body armor. Very often they mention a need for <i><b>stab proof vests or stab proof body armor</i></b>. Examples include the

                Clearly, the Proud Boys were very interested in acquiring stab proof vests because of 
                "<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20201213043848/https://www.the-sun.com/news/1959359/million-maga-march-dc-trump-steal-election-stabbing/"><b>recent events</b></a>" 
                at the previous D.C. rally in December,
                when multiple Proud Boys 
                <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20201213174544/https://wjla.com/news/local/man-arrested-after-hes-accused-of-stabbing-4-in-dc-in-night-of-unrest">were

                in the street. During the conspiracy trial, the prosecution claimed that the Proud
                Boys brought equipment and body armor to DC on Jan 6 in preparation for attacking the police and storming the Capitol. But a <b>stab proof vest</b> is useless against
                the police, who, <a href="https://sigsegv1980.github.io/j6/2020-07-05-USAvChristopherFellini.pdf#page=8">unlike <b>Antifa</b></a>, generally do not use knives.

                To be fair to the prosecution, it's certainly possible that the Proud Boys' decision to not wear colors on Jan 6 was <i>also</i> at least <i>partially</i>
                motivated by a desire to avoid the police to some extent, especially given the Proud Boys' increasing distrust and animosity towards the DC police
                after their experience at the previous DC rally on December 12, 2020 (see <a href="#anc20">below discussion about the Proud Boys' changing relationship with
                the police</a> prior to Jan 6). But the bulk of the Telegram evidence reveals that the "no color" policy was
                <i>mostly</i> an attempt to hide from and/or blend in with <b>Antifa</b>. In particular, there's no evidence the Proud Boys made any
                advance arrangements <i>specifically</i> to conceal their Jan 6 plans from the police, apart from basic OPSEC practices. 
                On the contrary, since 2019, <b>Enrique Tarrio</b> was 
                <a href="https://sigsegv1980.github.io/j6/ShaneLamondAndEnriqueTarrioMessagesAndCommunications.pdf">regularly in contact

                        38. On December 29, 2020, TARRIO posted a message to the MOSD Prospect Group to notify prospective members of a virtual meeting on December 30 to 
                        explain "how this all works." 
                        TARRIO advised the group that the MOSD "will have a top down structure" and advised prospects that, "if that's something you're not comfortable with" 
                        they should not bother attending the live session. TARRIO advised that "upper tier leadership" would consist of a three-person "Operations" section 
                        led by REHL, PERSON-3 and one other person. TARRIO advised that the "Marketing" section would be led by TARRIO, BIGGS and NORDEAN. TARRIO advised that 
                        "second tier" leadership would consist of eight regional members.

                Included in the indictment to once again emphasize the "top down structure" and rigid, strict nature of the <b>MOSD</b> chapter, suggesting to the reader
                that the <b>MOSD</b> chapter was a militaristic organization created for the express purpose of storming the Capitol building. Additionally, this paragraph
                suggests that the <b>MOSD</b> chapter involved a sophisticated level of planning, with references to a multi-tier leadership structure
                with "Operations" and "Marketing" divisions. This shows evidence of planning, but does not show <i>WHAT</i> the Proud Boys were
                planning for Jan 6, again relying on <i><b>confirmation bias</b></i> to kick in and mislead the reader to interpret any evidence of planning as evidence of a
                <b>seditious conspiracy</b> to storm the Capitol.
                <br><br>
                The indictment also omits certain exculpatory parts of <b>Tarrio's</b> post, such as when he said <i>"we are going to be using the 6th as a test"</i>.
                This statement doesn't easily fit with the prosecution's seditious conspiracy case, but it is entirely consistent
                with <b>Enrique Tarrio's</b> <a href="#anc13"><i><b>actual</b></i> plan for January 6th</a>. 
                <br><br>
                More significantly, the indictment brings up the <i>"virtual meeting on December 30"</i>. This Zoom meeting — hereinafter referred to
                as the <b>MOSD Zoom meeting</b> — lasted over an hour and a half and is
                <b><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9HY3IVStIJc">available on video in its entirety</a></b>. (See also the full
                <a href="https://sigsegv1980.github.io/j6/ProudBoys-2020-12-30-MOSDZoomMeetingTranscript.pdf">transcript</a>). This video stands
                out as very significant <b><i>exculpatory evidence</i></b>. The <b>MOSD Zoom meeting</b> was held about a week before
                January 6th, yet throughout the <i>entire</i> hour and a half long discussion between upper-tier <b>MOSD</b> leaders, including
                the "big 3" (<b>Enrique Tarrio</b>, <b>Joe Biggs</b> and <b>Ethan Nordean</b>), there was not a <i>single mention</i> of any plan to storm the Capitol or anything
                remotely similar. The meeting clarifies the <i>real</i> purpose of the <b>MOSD</b> chapter, which was to address 
                major disciplinary and organizational problems experienced during the 
                <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20201213043848/https://www.the-sun.com/news/1959359/million-maga-march-dc-trump-steal-election-stabbing/">previous DC

                <b>Tarrio</b> feared that such

                During the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9HY3IVStIJc"><b>MOSD Zoom meeting</b></a> the Proud Boys discussed establishing new rallying policies (like 
                <a href="https://youtu.be/9HY3IVStIJc?t=1019">splitting up into smaller squads</a>) to make it easier 
                to stay in formation while marching through the streets during rallies.

                Ultimately, the <b><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9HY3IVStIJc">MOSD Zoom meeting video</a></b> suggests that the Proud Boys' <b><i>real</i></b> 
                plan for Jan 6 was simply to <b>field test</b> the new <b>MOSD</b> command structure  — to take the <b>MOSD</b> chapter out for a spin in the 
                streets of DC in a march and see if it works as anticipated.
                This is also consistent with <b>Charles Donohoe</b>'s
                description of the plan for Jan 6 as 
                <i>“<a href="https://sigsegv1980.github.io/j6/ProudBoys-ExportedTelegramChatMOSDOp/messages.html#go_to_message441"><b>a simple and quick mission</b></a>”</i>,
                and also matches what <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oSOsG5kN5wc">the Proud Boys were observed <b><i>actually doing</i></b> on the morning of January 6th</a> 
                before the Capitol riot began.
                The objective was to conduct a march while staying together in formation and observing the new rallying protocols established
                by the <b>MOSD</b> leadership, such as 
                splitting into smaller 10 man squads

                (300 First Street NE) by the Capitol between 10 AM and 12 PM. (See Government Exhibit <b>501-56</b> showing

                    <div class="inner-blurb">
                        At approximately 2:13 p.m., PEZZOLA used the riot shield he had taken from a
                        Capitol Police officer to break a window of the Capitol. The first members of the mob entered the
                        Capitol through this broken window.
                    </div>
                </div>
                <b>Dominic Pezzola's</b> defense admitted that Pezzola smashed the window,
                but <a href="2023-08-06-USAvDominicPezzola-DefendantPezzolasReplyToUnitedStatesResponseToPezzolaRule29and33Motions.pdf">
                denied that Pezzola was the first person to actually breach the Capitol building</a> and also denied that the first members of the mob
                entered through a breach created by Pezzola. The defense claimed that an unidentified individual wearing a red cap, 
                glasses and a red sweater first smashed through the window, and that the first rioters entered through the breach
                created by this unidentified <b>rioter in red</b>. 
                <br><br>
                At face value, the prosecution's claim here about <b>Dominic Pezzola</b> has little relevance to the <b>seditious conspiracy</b> charges,
                because it has nothing to do with advance planning. However, the prosecution believed that their conspiracy case was
                bolstered by the fact that some Proud Boys
                were among the <i>first wave</i> of rioters to breach the Capitol, with <b>Pezzola</b> being among the first.
                While it's true that <b>Pezzola</b> was among the first wave of rioters, the prosecution's description of
                <b>Pezzola's</b> actions was somewhat misleading, if not factually incorrect. The defense
                claimed that Pezzola was <i>NOT</i> the first rioter to breach the Capitol, and that the first members of the mob did
                <i>not</i> enter the Capitol building through a breach created by <b>Dominic Pezzola</b>, instead claiming that an 
                unidentified <b>rioter in red</b> was the first person to breach the Capitol and let in the mob. The defense's claim
                is corroborated by <b><a href="PezzolaSmashingWindowPane-720.mp4">video of the incident</a></b>, but the prosecution was not
                entirely wrong either, thanks to some clever wording in the indictment. 
                <br><br>
                In the video, we can
                see that the window in question is still undamaged at timestamp <b>0:08</b>. The window disappears from view after that, as the
                camera pans over to the left. Then at timestamp <b>0:16</b>, 
                the camera pans back to the window, and we see that the <b>right window pane</b> has been cracked. Then at timestamp <b>0:20</b>, someone dressed in red,
                wearing a red cap and a white surgical face mask, smashes through 
                the right window pane by hurling a thin board of wood like a spear. Finally, <b>Dominic Pezzola</b> comes along and smashes
                the <b>left window pane</b> using a riot shield around 20 seconds later at <b>0:40</b>.

                To be fair to the prosecution, the unidentified <b>rioter in red</b> smashed through the right window pane first, but didn't 
                completely clear away all the glass. <b>Dominic
                Pezzola</b> then came along and smashed through the <i>left</i> window pane using a riot shield, completely clearing away all the
                glass. Then the unidentified <b>rioter in red</b> cleared away the remaining glass from the <i>right</i> pane at <b>0:51</b>. So perhaps
                the question of who first "breached" the Capitol building is open to interpretation. The unidentified
                <b>rioter in red</b> smashed through the right window pane before Dominic Pezzola arrived. But <b>Dominic Pezzola</b> was the first 
                rioter to clear <i>enough</i> glass from the window pane to enable people to climb through. However, the first person to actually
                enter the Capitol building climbed through the <i><b>right</b></i> window pane at <b>0:57</b>. The right pane was
                smashed and cleared by the unidentified <b>rioter in red</b>, not Pezzola.
                <br><br>
                Regardless, Pezzola's direct message to <b>Enrique Tarrio</b> is included in the indictment most likely to suggest a close relationship between Tarrio
                and Pezzola. <b>Dominic Pezzola</b> (“<b>Spazzo - 2nd°</b>” on Telegram) was a rank-and-file Proud Boy rather than a leader with any authority or decision making power within
                the <b>MOSD</b> chapter. Pezzola clearly had never even met Tarrio at the time this message was sent on December 29, 2020, merely a week
                before January 6. Pezzola was rather late to the party, having become a Proud Boy less than <i>two months</i> before Jan 6
                (see <a href="https://sigsegv1980.github.io/j6/2023-04-05-USAvProudBoys-TranscriptOfJuryTrial-Day60.pdf#page=82">trial testimony of Lisa Magee</a>), 
                and joining the 
                <a href="https://sigsegv1980.github.io/j6/ProudBoys-MOSD-Main-2020-12-27_2021-1-4.pdf#page=18"><b>MOSD MAIN</b> Telegram chat group</a> as late as January 2,
                only 4 days before Jan 6 (see Government Exhibit <b>507-7</b>). Thus, the connection between Tarrio and Pezzola,
                and by extension Pezzola's involvement in the alleged conspiracy, was
                somewhat tenuous.
                <br><br>
                But since <b>Pezzola</b> happened to be one of the first rioters to breach the Capitol building, the prosecution
                wanted to strengthen the connection between <b>Pezzola's</b> action and <b>Tarrio's</b> planning. The inclusion of this Telegram post
                in the indictment is meant to strengthen the link between Pezzola and Tarrio, suggesting to the reader that when Pezzola 
                smashed the window and breached the Capitol, he was carrying out Tarrio's plans. <b>Pezzola</b> was ultimately
                the only Proud Boy acquitted of the <b>seditious conspiracy</b> charge.

                        41. Between December 30 and December 31, 2020, TARRIO communicated multiple
                        times with an individual whose identity is known to the grand jury. On December 30,2020, this
                        individual sent TARRIO a nine-page document titled, “1776 Returns.” The document set forth a
                        plan to occupy a few “crucial buildings” in Washington, D.C., on January 6, including House and
                        Senate office buildings around the Capitol, with as “many people as possible” to “show our
                        politicians We the People are in charge.” After sending the document, the individual stated, “The
                        revolution is important than anything.” TARRIO responded, “That's what every waking moment
                        consists of ... I'm not playing games.”

                The text message conversation between <b>Enrique Tarrio</b> and <b>Eryka Gemma</b> is not entirely clear, and there is almost
                certainly some missing context. The part of their conversation made publicly available through Government Exhibit <b>523-1</b> (quoted in the left column)
                is almost certainly a snippet of a larger conversation.
                <b>Eryka Gemma</b> reminds <b>Tarrio</b> that <i>“the revolution”</i> (presumably meaning the
                the plan described in <i><b>1776 Returns</b></i>) is more <i>“important than anything”</i>. She appears to be
                frustrated with <b>Tarrio</b> for some reason, perhaps perceiving him to be non-committal in some way to the
                plan she proposed. <b>Tarrio</b> responds with <b><i>“That’s what every waking moment consists of”</i></b>, which 
                a reasonable person can interpret as an expression of assent or
                commitment. 
                <br><br>
                A <a href="https://x.com/kyledcheney/status/1623871519435681794">
                journalist with Politico</a> interpreted <b>Tarrio</b>'s statement to mean that <b>Tarrio</b>
                was so fully committed to <b>Eryka Gemma</b>'s plan that he
                spent <i>“every waking moment”</i> thinking about revolution and storming the Capitol.
                But <b>Tarrio's</b> statement is somewhat cryptic and isn't necessarily an expression of commitment or support because 
                <b>Eryka Gemma</b>'s next message suggested
                dissatisfaction with his response.
                She said <b><i>“WellC If you don’t like my plan, let me know. I will pitch elsewhere”</i></b>, suggesting she interpreted
                <b>Tarrio</b>'s response as something less than a firm commitment. She gives <b>Tarrio</b> an ultimatum and
                then adds <b><i>“If not, stop playing games with me”</i></b>. <b>Tarrio</b> replies <i>“...I’m not playing games.”</i>
                <br><br>
                Both the
                indictment and the <a href="https://www.govinfo.gov/content/pkg/GPO-J6-REPORT/html-submitted/ch6.html">J6 report</a> <b>misleadingly omit</b>
                all but <i>one</i> of <b>Eryka Gemma</b>'s text messages, making it appear as if <b>Tarrio</b> said <i>“I’m not playing games”</i> 
                as an expression of firm committment in response to <b>Eryka Gemma</b>'s statement about the importance of <i>“the revolution”</i>, when in fact
                <b>Tarrio</b> was responding specifically to <b>Eryka Gemma's</b> message accusing him
                of <i>“playing games”</i>. Moreover, <b>Eryka Gemma's</b> apparent snarkiness suggests 
                an alternate interpretation of <b>Tarrio's</b>
                text messages. Perhaps when
                <b>Tarrio</b> said <b><i>“That’s what every waking moment consists of”</i></b>, he was actually expressing a more
                passive aggressive sentiment along the lines of “This again? This revolution is all you ever talk about”. That interpretation
                better fits <b>Eryka Gemma's</b> immediate response and her overall attitude, and it makes the entire conversation more logical and coherent.
                <br><br>
                This alternate interpretation 
                is also consistent with information revealed during the trial regarding some of the omitted
                text messages surrounding the <a href="https://sigsegv1980.github.io/j6/ProudBoys-TarrioDMsAndGroupChats-2020-12-19_2021-1-4.pdf#page=11">publicly available snippet</a>

                explicitly confirm that this characterization was accurate, but she did not dispute it. The characterization
                is at least consistent with <b>Eryka's</b> apparent frustration evident in the excerpt available to us.
                <br><br>
                Regardless, the prosecution framed <i><b>1776 Returns</b></i> as a highly incriminating piece of evidence
                supporting their <b>seditious conspiracy</b> case and demonstrating that <b>Enrique Tarrio</b>, who was not present
                in Washington DC on January 6, nonetheless planned and orchestrated the Jan 6 storming of the US Capitol building
                using <i><b>1776 Returns</b></i> as a playbook. However, a closer examination of
                the <i><b>1776 Returns</b></i> document immediately calls this entire premise into question.
                <br><br>
                The most obvious problem is that the plan described in <a href="https://sigsegv1980.github.io/j6/ProudBoys-1776Returns.pdf"><i><b>1776 Returns</b></i></a>
                bears very little resemblance to what <i>actually</i> happened on January 6, 2021. In fact, the plan in <i><b>1776 Returns</b></i> does not even
                involve the US Capitol building at all. Rather, <i><b>1776 Returns</b></i> calls for multiple groups of 50 or more people
                to simultaneously occupy at least 8 different buildings, including Senate and House office buildings, the Supreme Court and the CNN building 
                (but <i>not</i> the Capitol building itself), 
                in order to demand a new election 
                without mail-in ballots while remaining
                inside the occupied buildings for an extended 1960s-style “sit-in” until the demand is met.  
                The plan calls for individual "covert sleepers", dressed
                in business suits, to infiltrate
                each building in advance by booking fake
                appointments in order to let other protesters inside. The plan also suggests pulling
                fire alarms at locations throughout DC (including museums, hotels, and Walmart) to distract the police. Manpower for the operation is to be 
                recruited by a special team of recruiters tasked with handing out copies 
                of the <i><b>1776 Returns</b></i> plan on the streets of DC.
                <br><br>

                <br><br>
                Moreover, the actual Jan 6 Capitol riot involved kinetic violence, as rioters threw their bodies and makeshift projectiles at police defensive
                lines, whereas the plan described in <i><b>1776 Returns</b></i> is 
                entirely <i><b>non-violent</b></i> and has
                more in common with a Civil Rights era “sit-in” than the pepper-spray fueled chaotic melee that actually happened on January 6.
                <a href="https://sigsegv1980.github.io/j6/ProudBoys-1776Returns.pdf"><i><b>1776 Returns</b></i></a> presents
                a more intricate and detailed plan, involving specialized roles, “covert sleepers”, coordinated diversions, and multiple teams  
                simultaneously occupying 8 
                separate buildings (<i>not</i> including the US Capitol building). But the <i>actual</i> riot that happened on January 6 involved a large mob 
                of Trump supporters
                traveling from the Ellipse towards the Capitol building in dribs and drabs, accumulating by the Capitol's West Front 
                where the mob began a blunt, full-frontal assault
                on police defensive lines, breaching barricades and smashing through windows, before entering the building and splintering into 
                groups that meandered about inside with little cohesive action and no coherent political objective.
                No demands were ever formally issued, no extended “sit-in” was attempted, and there were no “covert sleepers” or recruiters handing out 
                copies of the plan on the streets of DC. Pretty
                much <b><i>nothing</i></b> described in <i><b>1776 Returns</b></i> actually happened on January 6, 2021.
                <br><br>
                Moreover, throughout all the <b>MOSD</b> Telegram evidence 
                and the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9HY3IVStIJc"><b>MOSD</b> Zoom call</a>, there are <i><b>zero</b></i> references to 
                the plan described in <i><b>1776 Returns</b></i>.
                There is scant evidence that any Proud Boy apart from <b>Enrique Tarrio</b> even knew the document existed.
                Furthermore, there is an unedited <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oSOsG5kN5wc"><b>one hour and 40 minute livestream</b></a> 
                documenting the actions of the Proud Boys under the command
                of <b>Ethan Nordean</b> on the morning of January 6 before the riot. Yet throughout this livestream, we never see any Proud Boys 
                doing <i>anything</i> described in <i><b>1776 Returns</b></i>. We never see anyone
                handing out copies of the plan or attempting to distract police by pulling fire alarms. We never see any “covert sleepers” 
                wearing suits while infiltrating Senate office buildings. We never even hear the Proud Boys use any of the suggested
                chants listed in <i><b>1776 Returns</b></i>, such as <i>“Liberty or Death!”</i> or <i>“No Trump, No America!”</i>. Instead, the livestream consists 
                mostly of the Proud Boys marching
                around Washington DC chanting <i>“<a href="https://youtu.be/oSOsG5kN5wc?t=2905"><b>Fuck Antifa!</b></a>”</i> before stopping to eat 
                lunch by the <a href="https://youtu.be/oSOsG5kN5wc?t=4257">
                food trucks</a> on Constitution Avenue.
                <br><br>
                If we accept the prosecution's argument that the Proud Boys used <i><b>1776 Returns</b></i> as a playbook
                for January 6, then we must also conclude that the Proud Boys completely failed to actually execute <i>anything</i> described in 
                <i><b>1776 Returns</b></i>,
                and instead ended up coincidentally participating in a completely <i>unrelated</i> riot driven by a mob of Trump
                supporters who bluntly attacked the Capitol building head-on. Indeed, the plan described in <i><b>1776 Returns</b></i>
                is totally incompatible with the prosecution's <i>own</i> <b>seditious conspiracy</b> case. The prosecution argued that the 
                Proud Boys devised a plan to rile up a crowd
                of “normie” Trump supporters and harness them as a battering ram to breach police defensive lines and storm the Capitol building.
                But this plan is <i>nothing</i> like the non-violent, coordinated “sit-ins” described in <i><b>1776 Returns</b></i>.
                <br><br>
                We know that on December 30, 2020, <b>Eryka Gemma</b> sent the 
                <a href="https://sigsegv1980.github.io/j6/ProudBoys-1776Returns.pdf"><i><b>1776 Returns</b></i></a> document to <b>Enrique Tarrio</b>.
                Yet nothing described in <i><b>1776 Returns</b></i> actually happened on January 6. How do we explain this? Our options are somewhat limited. Either:
                <br><br>
                <ol>
                <li><b>Tarrio</b> ignored <i><b>1776 Returns</b></i> and devised a completely different plan to storm the Capitol;
                </li>
                <li>
                    <b>Tarrio</b> 
                    initially intended to execute the <i><b>1776 Returns</b></i> plan but later changed his mind after unforseen circumstances 
                    (e.g. <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20220712213106/https://twitter.com/maustermuhle/status/1346521554855874565">getting arrested</a> on Jan 4) 
                    rendered the plan infeasible;
                </li>
                <li>
                    <b>Tarrio</b> ignored <i><b>1776 Returns</b></i> because he never
                    had any real plan to storm <i>anything</i>, and assumed January 6 would play out mostly like a normal rally.
                </li>
                </ol>
                <br>
                The weight of the Telegram and video evidence <i>strongly</i> supports
                <b>Option 3</b>. On multiple occasions, <b>Enrique Tarrio</b>
                indicated that the primary objective for January 6 was to field test the new rallying policies 
                established under the <b>Ministry of Self Defense (MOSD)</b> chapter. <b>Tarrio</b> stated that the <b>MOSD</b> 
                Proud Boys would be running 
                a <i>“<b>training exercise</b>”</i> during 
                <i>“<a href="https://sigsegv1980.github.io/j6/ProudBoys-MOSD-MAIN-FullChatMessages-2020-12-27_2021-1-1.pdf#page=118">the 
                5th at night and 6th throughout the day</a>”</i>
                and that <i>“<a href="https://sigsegv1980.github.io/j6/ProudBoys-MOSD-Main-2020-12-27_2021-1-4.pdf#page=8">we are going to be using the 6th <b>as a test</b></a> [of the new MOSD policies]”</i>
                (see Govt Exhibit <b>503-18</b>). This is consistent with the stated purpose of the <b>MOSD</b> chapter, which was established specifically 
                <a href="https://sigsegv1980.github.io/j6/ProudBoys-SkullAndBonesChat-2020-9-29_2021-1-4.pdf#page=10">to curtail aggressive behavior</a> (Govt Exhibit <b>500-69</b>) 
                from rank-and-file Proud Boys at national rallies, and to
                make it easier to <a href="https://youtu.be/9HY3IVStIJc?t=2161">control and direct “rank and file” Proud Boys while maintaining formation</a>
                during marches. (See the above sections on <a href="#anc11">the purpose of the <b>MOSD</b> chapter</a> and the
                <a href="#anc13">Proud Boys' <b><i>true</i></b> plan for Jan 6</a> for a more exhaustive review of this evidence.)
                <br><br>
                Regardless of which option we pick, <a href="https://sigsegv1980.github.io/j6/ProudBoys-1776Returns.pdf"><i><b>1776 Returns</b></i></a> amounts to 
                a mere distraction or “red herring”, because nothing described in this
                document actually happened on January 6. Thus, <i><b>1776 Returns</b></i> provided very little utility to the prosecution 
                apart from a vague suggestion that the document <i>may</i> have influenced the Proud Boys in 
                some unspecified way to devise a completely <i>different</i> plan to storm a completely <i>different</i> building using completely <i>different</i>
                tactics on January 6.
                <br><br>
                Furthermore, the plan described in <i><b>1776 Returns</b></i> is not necessarily unique. The idea of
                storming
                or occupying buildings was a prevalent feature of the zeitgeist surrounding the <b>“Stop the Steal”</b> MAGA movement in late 2020,
                with over <b>3,900</b> Parler posts (including echoes) that encourage the 
                <a href="https://sigsegv1980.github.io/j6/ZenodoParlerPostsFromNovember2020ToJanuary2021WithKeywordStormTheCapitol_IncludingEchoes.html">storming</a>
                or <a href="https://sigsegv1980.github.io/j6/ParlerPostsUsingOccupyLikeProgressives_2020_IncludingEchoes.html">occupying</a> 
                of government/administrative buildings appearing between
                November 2020 and January 5, 2021.
                One  
                <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20210110195420/https://parler.com/post/23721ad336f242ff818d136070c424cd">Parler post from a user named @Isleofkent2141</a>
                that encourages Trump supporters to enter federal buildings on January 6 has some interesting similarities to 
                <i><b>1776 Returns</b></i> and mentions many of the same target buildings. Thus, any broad similarities between the plan described in <i><b>1776 Returns</b></i> and
                the actual events that happened on January 6 cannot even be reliably attributed to the influence of <i><b>1776 Returns</b></i>.
                The document is therefore mostly irrelevant to the <b>seditious conspiracy</b> case, because it had no observable
                effect on the events of January 6 (apart from teaching <b>Enrique Tarrio</b> a little Russian history), and any indirect influence it may have exerted is 
                entirely within the realm of conjecture.

                While the <a href="https://sigsegv1980.github.io/j6/ProudBoys-1776Returns.pdf"><i><b>1776 Returns</b></i></a> document ultimately amounts to a distraction, its mysterious origin
                nonetheless makes it an object of interest and curiosity. Where did this document come from and who wrote it? 
                The document is peppered with verbiage drawn from the American Revolution like <i>“We The People”</i>. But the document also
                prominently features the phrase <b><i>“The Winter Palace”</i></b>, clearly inspired by the 1917 Bolshevik Revolution in Russia, 
                making it a major linguistic outlier among online right-wing discourse. The language used on social media within
                the online MAGA-sphere often draws from the patriotic ethos of the American Revolution, but rarely from Vladimir
                Lenin and his left-wing revolutionaries. In fact, there are only <a href="https://sigsegv1980.github.io/j6/ParlerPosts-WinterPalace.html">
                <b>four</b> Parler posts containing the phrase <b>“Winter Palace”</b></a>
                (out of over 98 million posts contained in the <a href="https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.4442460">Zenodo Parler Database</a>). The fact that 
                <a href="https://sigsegv1980.github.io/j6/ProudBoys-TarrioDMsAndGroupChats-2020-12-19_2021-1-4.pdf#page=19"><b>Enrique Tarrio</b> used the
                phrase <b><i>“Winter Palace”</i></b></a> (see Govt Exhibit <b>530-5</b>) on Telegram on the evening of January 6
                indicates that <b>Enrique Tarrio</b> almost certainly at least <i>read</i> <i><b>1776 Returns</b></i> at some point. But he
                certainly didn't <i>write</i> this mysterious document, since we know that <b>Eryka Gemma</b> sent it to him
                on December 30, 2020. <b>Enrique Tarrio</b>
                <a href="https://sigsegv1980.github.io/j6/ProudBoys-CellebriteExtractionShowingTarrioGoogleTheWinterPalace.jpg">
                Googled the phrase <b><i>“the winter palace”</i></b></a> on January 1, 2021, indicating he probably read <i><b>1776 Returns</b></i> but wasn't 
                familiar with the historical significance of the Winter Palace.
                <br><br>
                <b>Eryka Gemma</b>
                implied she was the author of <i><b>1776 Returns</b></i> when she said to <b>Enrique Tarrio</b> <i>“WellC If you don’t like <b>my plan</b>...”</i>. 
                The mysterious document also ends
                with a “Special Mention” section that praises Florida Governor Ron DeSantis and Senator Rand Paul. <b>Eryka Gemma</b> is a resident
                of Florida and she <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20221229014629/https://witi.com/conferences/2017/summit/speakers-lightbox.php?id=1307">
                campaigned for Ron Paul</a> (the father of Rand Paul) in 2012. 
                Furthermore, <b>Eryka Gemma</b> <a href="https://youtu.be/ZQawR_tbIC8?t=16749">used the word “<b>revolutionary</b>”</a> while being
                interviewed in mid-December of 2020, well before she sent <b>Tarrio</b> the <i><b>1776 Returns</b></i> document.
                And in a now deleted

                <b>Eryka Gemma</b> wrote <i>“The Russian revolution only occurred because they <b>stormed in the winter capitol</b>.”</i>
                Finally, according to the <a href="https://sigsegv1980.github.io/j6/2023-03-14-USAvProudBoys-TranscriptOfJuryTrial-Day47.pdf#page=57">trial testimony

                <b>Armes</b> wrote about a scenario where generic radical groups (either right-wing or left-wing) cause chaos and
                hold sit-ins in various government buildings around Capitol Hill.
                However, <b>Samuel Armes</b> denied writing any part of <i><b>1776 Returns</b></i> that was
                ostensibly right-wing or pro-Trump, including the title <i>“1776 Returns”</i>. He also denied using the phrase <b><i>“Winter Palace”</i></b>,
                and claimed to have only
                a vague understanding of what that phrase even signifies. Finally, <b>Samuel Armes</b> <a href="https://sigsegv1980.github.io/j6/2022-07-18-DepositionOfSamuelArmes.pdf#page=12">
                told the J6 Committee</a>
                that he casually discussed these “wargaming” scenarios while socializing with
                <b>Eryka Gemma</b> some time in or after August of 2020. According to Armes, <b>Eryka Gemma</b> showed interest 
                in his ideas and asked him to email her the document, so he did.
                <br><br>
                While there is still quite a bit of uncertainty surrounding the origins of <a href="https://sigsegv1980.github.io/j6/ProudBoys-1776Returns.pdf"><i><b>1776 Returns</b></i></a>,
                the most likely scenario is that <b>Samuel Armes</b>' testimony is at least partially true, meaning he authored an initial draft of the document and
                emailed it to <b>Eryka Gemma</b>, who (perhaps in collaboration with others) repurposed it into a 9 page tactical brief. 
                <b>Eryka Gemma</b> then sent it to <b>Enrique Tarrio</b> on
                December 30, 2020, hoping he would use it as a playbook for January 6. <b>Tarrio</b> likely read it on January 1, 2021, then 
                <a href="https://sigsegv1980.github.io/j6/ProudBoys-CellebriteExtractionShowingTarrioGoogleTheWinterPalace.jpg">Googled <i>“the winter palace”</i></a>,
                and then pretty much forgot about <i><b>1776 Returns</b></i> or perhaps put it on the back burner.

                    completely different, because the fact that 
                        we're, we're not going to be in colors, uh, one of the things I've been really hearing a lot about is like, oh my god, I'm hearing so much this about what's going 
                        on DC or that's going to possibly be going on in DC... Guys, look you gotta understand, we're going without colors, so, uh, a lot of, a lot of the fears and dynamics 
                        that people are thinking about are just complete bullshit and just ramble, I mean, and realistically like, I... every single rally I've done since like, like 2015, 
                        I've heard the same bullshit anyway, so I mean, it, it's, it's, it's just, it's just rumbles, and, and, and arguments.
                        <br><br>But like, um, while we're in DC and everything, I mean, it's not gonna be the same thing. We're not, we're not gonna be doing like, a Proud Bully 
                        fucking, um, you know, eight o'clock in early, uh, march, uh, and, and, and, and flexing our, flexing our guns, and shit. So you guys gotta understand that 
                        we're not doing that this time, you know, we're doing a completely different operation and there's, there's going to be a lot of uh... contingencies and, and 
                        plans laid out of what we're actually going to do and there's going to be teams, they're gonna be put together to, you know, um, you know, where they're gonna 
                        be going and what they're doing, so keep that in mind too, and like, when you tell your guys that kind of thing, um, you know, spread that word a little bit. 
                        I mean, don't, don't, don't spread it too far, but you know, spread it to the guys that you plan on bringing and everything, so that we, we can actually work 
                        together and, and, and make this make this DC event a little bit more successful.</p>
                        <br>
                        <p>Because this is, this, this is the training ground for um, you know, this entire operation and this whole, you know, this structure and everything, so 
                        we want to make it, we want to make it, you know, successful and um, you know, we we definitely are going to run into some problems uh, maybe maybe some 
                        errors, but we want to learn from those errors and then, and then work on those errors, so that we you know we don't make those errors again in the future 
                        at the next rally, so, yeah, I just wanted to throw that out there and uh...</p>

                Next, in one of the <i><b>most misleading sections</b></i> yet, the indictment pulls two fragments from <b>Zach Rehl's</b> long-winded, rambling
                speech to the <b>MOSD</b> leadership during the <a href="https://youtu.be/9HY3IVStIJc?t=5604"><b>December 30, 2020 MOSD Zoom meeting</b>
                at timestamp <b>1:33:24</b></a> (see
                <a href="https://sigsegv1980.github.io/j6/ProudBoys-2020-12-30-MOSDZoomMeetingTranscript.pdf#page=52">transcript</a>).
                The quoted fragments are an attempt to mislead the reader into believing that <b>Zach Rehl</b> called Jan 6 a "<i>completely different operation</i>" because it
                was an operation that involved storming the Capitol.
                <br><br>
                But when read (or <a href="https://youtu.be/9HY3IVStIJc?t=5604">watched</a>) in full, <b>Zach Rehl's</b> rambling speech more or less summarizes the purpose of the 
                <b>MOSD chapter</b>, which was
                to implement new rules and protocols that address organizational and disciplinary issues that arose during the previous MAGA rally in December. 
                These new protocols included 
                splitting into smaller 10 man squads 
                (timestamp <a href="https://youtu.be/9HY3IVStIJc?t=1019"><b>16:59</b></a>), 
                not wearing identifying colors (timestamp <a href="https://youtu.be/9HY3IVStIJc?t=3669"><b>1:01:09</b></a>), 
                not getting drunk or high during the rally (timestamp <a href="https://youtu.be/9HY3IVStIJc?t=280"><b>4:40</b></a>), 
                and <b>always acting defensively instead of offensively</b> (timestamps 
                <a href="https://youtu.be/9HY3IVStIJc?t=473"><b>7:53</b></a>, 
                <a href="https://youtu.be/9HY3IVStIJc?t=1923"><b>32:03</b></a>, 
                <a href="https://youtu.be/9HY3IVStIJc?t=2009"><b>33:29</b></a>).
                <br><br>
                These protocols were also meant to mitigate the difficulty of marching hundreds of people while maintaining formation, which was a major 
                source of frustration for <b>Enrique Tarrio</b> at the previous rally in December. <b>Tarrio</b>
                <a href="https://sigsegv1980.github.io/j6/ProudBoys-OfficialPresidentsChat-2020-8-7_2020-12-31.pdf#page=18">compared it to herding cats</a>
                (see Government Exhibit <b>514-34</b>), because individual Proud Boys often lacked discipline while marching and broke formation after being provoked:

                <b>strong exculpatory evidence</b>. The Proud Boys talk for over an hour
                and a half, discussing the purpose of the <b>MOSD</b> chapter along with new rallying strategies and safety measures, but 
                never once is there any mention of
                storming the Capitol or anything remotely similar. Rather, the <b>MOSD</b> chapter was created to enforce structure
                and discipline during all future national rallies (including Jan 6), with the goal of making it easier to control and direct
                large numbers of Proud Boys on the ground:

                        have 700 guys going, you know, two blocks over, just because they see the guy next to him moving.

                        control.

                All of this is consistent with private discussions the Proud Boys had amongst themselves on Telegram on December 30, 2020, the same day

                As the <b>MOSD Zoom meeting</b> was coming to an end, <b>Zach Rehl</b> 
                said he wanted to <i>"<a href="https://youtu.be/9HY3IVStIJc?t=5702"><b>make this DC event a little bit more successful</b></a>"</i> 
                (timestamp <b>1:35:02</b>). But what does the 
                prosecution think this even means? Does it mean that <b>Zach Rehl</b> thinks storming the Capitol will "<i>make this DC event a little bit more successful</i>"? 
                <b>Zach Rehl's</b> rambling speech essentially just summarizes the goal of the <b>MOSD</b> chapter, which was to 
                <a href="https://youtu.be/9HY3IVStIJc?t=443"><b>improve the way the Proud Boys conduct rallies</b></a>. 
                <b>Rehl</b> suggested this would be an iterative process that would involve some mistakes, but over time, and after multiple future rallies, the Proud Boys 
                would eventually get it right. Nothing <b>Zach Rehl</b> says here suggests any seditious plans to storm the Capitol:

                Again, it's fairly obvious this entire hour and a half long Zoom meeting was about improving future Proud Boy rallies 
                (“<a href="https://youtu.be/9HY3IVStIJc?t=443"><b>a way to do rallies better</b><a>”) by
                establishing a stricter command structure and implementing new rallying policies via the new <b>MOSD</b> chapter, and that
                Jan 6 was to be used <i>“<a href="https://youtu.be/9HY3IVStIJc?t=1460"><b>as a training exercise</b></a>”</i> to 
                test drive this new chapter. There is no hint anyone was even <i>thinking</i> about
                storming the Capitol at the time of the Zoom meeting on December 30th, 2020, about a week before Jan 6.

                Included in the indictment because it shows <b>Enrique Tarrio</b> saying scary things which, while once again not
                constituting evidence of any actual specific plan to "revolt" or storm the Capitol, complements
                the earlier paragraph in the indictment about the <i><b>“1776 Returns”</i></b> document while also suggesting to the reader that Tarrio
                is probably the sort of person who <i>would</i> do something like storm a Capitol building.
                <br><br>
                Of course, <b>Enrique Tarrio</b> says lots of things. In fact, he posted a <i><b>particularly incriminating</b></i> message on
                Telegram, ominously foreshadowing the January 6 Capitol siege. In this post, a photograph shows Tarrio standing alone in front 
                of the US Capitol building. Underneath is a caption reading "<i><b>I'm home. #Soon</b></i>".<br>😨
                <br><br>
                <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20230523110559/https://t.me/MiamiProudBoys/176">
                <img src="2019TelegramPostFromMiamiProudBoys-TarrioPosingByCapitol.png"/>
                </a>
                <br><br>
                Seems pretty damning, right? Except, this post wasn't included in the indictment, because 
                <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20230523110559/https://t.me/MiamiProudBoys/176"><b>Tarrio posted this back in November of 2019</b></a>. Clearly,
                <b>Tarrio</b> had no plan to "storm the Capitol" back in 2019, because Trump hadn't even lost the election at
                that point. No prosecutor could possibly argue that <b>Tarrio</b> had any motive to storm the Capitol back in 2019.
                Thus, we can conclude either that <b>Tarrio</b> is clairvoyant
                or owns a time machine, or that he's just a provocative guy who enjoys getting attention from posting vaguely threatening, cryptic messages on social media.
                <b>Tarrio's</b> <a href="https://sigsegv1980.github.io/j6/ZenodoParlerDump-NobleLeadPosts-2020.html">posting history</a> on Parler suggests we should not read too 
                deeply into these sort of cryptic messages because they are
                likely just a form of marketing. Indeed, <b>Tarrio</b> described his own job title in the <b>“Ministry of Self Defense”</b> (<b>MOSD</b>) chapter as
                “<a href="https://sigsegv1980.github.io/j6/ProudBoys-MOSD-Main-2020-12-27_2021-1-4.pdf#page=8"><b>Marketing</b></a>” (see Govt Exhibit <b>503-18</b>).
                <br><br>
                Finally, the indictment quotes <b>Tarrio</b> saying <i><b>“New Years Revolution”</i></b>, relying on
                the reader's <b>confirmation bias</b> to assume that the word <i>“Revolution”</i> implies violence. However,
                in another Parler post from <b>Enrique Tarrio</b>, posted in November of 2020, <b>Tarrio</b> said
                <i>“<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20201124184526/https://parler.com/post/03a1d304d43847feaf669e903139bb9b"><b>You don’t lead a revolution by force</b>... 
                You lead it through inspiration</a>”</i>, suggesting
                that the word <i>“revolution”</i> did not necessarily imply violence in <b>Tarrio's</b> mind.

                These Telegram posts were not included in the indictment, but they are relevant to the prosecution's argument that evidence of anti-police
                sentiment among the Proud Boys is also evidence that the Proud Boys conspired and planned in advance to attack police on Jan 6 as
                part of the plan to storm the Capitol. The prosecution also argued that Telegram and Parler posts exhibiting anti-police sentiment
                count as evidence that all the preparations the Proud Boys made prior to Jan 6, such as bringing protective
                equipment (body armor) and walkie-talkies, was for the express purpose of attacking police, and <i>not</i> for the purpose of
                fighting with <b>Antifa</b> and other counter-protesters (as the Proud Boys' defense argued).

                Once again, there is no direct evidence the Proud Boys planned to attack police in order to storm the Capitol. All we have are
                examples of the Proud Boys occasionally expressing anti-police sentiment on Telegram and Parler. 
                <br><br>
                Historically, the Proud Boys have generally supported the police. Throughout the late 2010s as the <i>Black Lives Matter</i> movement 
                rose to prominence and police departments across the country faced significant vitriol from the public, the Proud Boys 
                remained mostly loyal to the cops, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20190712164344/https://twitter.com/FordFischer/status/1146920889096839171">proudly declaring that “Blue Lives Matter”</a>.
                In the summer of 2020, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20200610052844/https://twitter.com/Enrique_Tarrio"><b>Enrique Tarrio</b> retweeted Mark Dice, saying "I stand with the police"</a>,

                        The Proud Boys' hostility towards the police was rooted in these events, and had nothing to do with January 6th.

                Thus, throughout late December of 2020 and January of 2021, the Proud Boys' leadership became 
                <a href="https://sigsegv1980.github.io/j6/ProudBoys-RufioParlerPost-2020-12-14.pdf">somewhat antagonistic</a>
                towards the D.C. police, which explains
                the anti-police messages the Proud Boys posted on Telegram and Parler. The prosecution argued that the Proud Boys turned against the 
                police because the Proud Boys wanted to storm the
                Capitol and therefore had to attack the police. But the historical context here surrounding the
                December 12th rally <i><b>independently</b></i> explains <i>why</i> the Proud Boys suddenly turned against the police around mid-December
                of 2020. The Proud Boys' anger towards the police was mostly a result of events during the December 12th, 2020 MAGA rally in DC,
                and it manifested mostly as 
                <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20210110205022/https://parler.com/post/62d57010f4ea4d1eac7b3d1d989abdf7">resentment over the way that 
                the DC police reacted to <b>Antifa</b> and <b>BLM</b> counter-protesters</a>. None of this had
                <i>anything</i> at all to do with some secret plan to storm the Capitol.
                <br><br>
                Thus, Telegram or Parler posts from the Proud Boys that exhibit anti-police sentiment are <i>not</i> evidence of
                a plan to attack police and storm the Capitol. We know why the Proud Boys turned against the cops, and it had nothing
                to do with Jan 6.

                        do nothing because they can do nothing.”

                This paragraph claims that on January 3rd, 2021, in the <b>MOSD MAIN</b> Telegram 
                group (called "MOSD Members" in the Civil Suit), the Proud Boys "<i>exchanged messages about attacking the Capitol</i>".
                This is <i><b>incredibly misleading</b></i> if not outright false, because it suggests the Proud Boys were having
                a conversation <i>about</i> storming the Capitol, implying an ongoing logistical discussion about the
                details of a plan to storm the Capitol. But we can look for ourselves at the discussions in the
                <a href="https://sigsegv1980.github.io/j6/ProudBoys-MOSD-Main-2020-12-27_2021-1-4.pdf"><b>MOSD MAIN Telegram group</b></a>
                on January 3, 2021 (<a href="https://sigsegv1980.github.io/j6/ProudBoys-MOSD-MAIN-FullChatMessages-2020-12-27_2021-1-1.pdf">or other days</a>),
                and see that no such planning discussions ever happened. 
                <br><br>
                The <a href="https://sigsegv1980.github.io/j6/ProudBoys-MOSD-Main-2020-12-27_2021-1-4.pdf#page=19">surrounding context</a> 
                reveals that <b>Jake Phillips'</b> post mentioning the storming of "<i>capitol buildings</i>" was a total <b><i>non-sequitur</i></b>,
                not part of some ongoing discussion about storming the Capitol. 
                The surrounding discussion was actually about a <a href="https://archive.ph/s6TVK"><b>photo posted on Facebook by Dan Scavino Jr.</b></a>, the White House Deputy Chief of Staff, 
                showing the White House at night with a beam of light shining down from above. The flag in the photo flying atop the
                White House is difficult to discern clearly, but the Proud Boys believed it was the <b>1776 flag</b>, an historical version of 
                the US flag with 13 stars arranged in a circle. (The 1776 pattern is easier to discern in a <a href="https://archive.ph/wip/kYlpy">sharpened version of the photo</a>.)  
                The Proud Boys mistakenly assumed the photo was taken the previous night,
                when in fact it was <a href="https://archive.ph/wip/bYLkO">originally posted to Facebook over a year earlier in June of 2019</a>.
                <br><br>
                Some of the Proud Boys interpreted the photo as an encouraging sign, perhaps even a signal from 
                President Trump. (<a href="https://archive.ph/s6TVK">User comments below the Facebook post</a> also 
                suggest the photo was interpreted as a signal
                from President Trump to his supporters.) <b>Jake Phillips</b> wondered 
                rhetorically if the <b>1776 flag</b> was perhaps a sign heralding a Trump victory that would 
                inspire “normies” (ordinary Trump supporters) to <i>“storm the capitol buildings”</i> <i>en masse</i>.
                <br><br>
                Of course, <b>Jake Phillips'</b> statement here did not exist in a vacuum. The idea of
                <i>storming</i>
                or <i>occupying</i> Capitol buildings was a prevalent feature of the ethos surrounding the 
                <b>“<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20201231183223/https://stopthesteal.us/">Stop the Steal</a>”</b> MAGA movement in late 2020,
                which centered largely around <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20201110195210/https://parler.com/profile/AlexJones/posts">State Capitol buildings</a> across the US.
                There were over <b>3,900</b> Parler posts (including echoes) from November 2020 through January 5, 2021, that encouraged the 
                <a href="https://sigsegv1980.github.io/j6/ZenodoParlerPostsFromNovember2020ToJanuary2021WithKeywordStormTheCapitol_IncludingEchoes.html"><b>storming</b></a>
                or <a href="https://sigsegv1980.github.io/j6/ParlerPostsUsingOccupyLikeProgressives_2020_IncludingEchoes.html"><b>occupying</b>
                of Capitol buildings</a> or other government/administrative buildings to protest the election. Indeed, a 
                <a href="https://sigsegv1980.github.io/j6/2020-12-30-SecretServiceProtectiveIntelligenceBriefOnJan6.pdf"><b>US Secret Service</b> intelligence
                briefing released a week before January 6th</a> reported on a pro-Trump movement <i>“to occupy Capitol Hill”</i>
                supported by “<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20201231183223/https://stopthesteal.us/"><b>Stop The Steal</b></a>” organizers like 
                <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20210105132318/https://twitter.com/ali/status/1346447147508621313">Ali Alexander</a>.
                Thus, whether or not the Proud Boys actually had a secret plan to storm the Capitol, it's very likely they would have at least been exposed to 
                the idea via social osmosis.
                <br><br>
                Regardless, there are no references to any <i>actual plan</i> to storm a Capitol building found among
                the Proud Boy Telegram evidence. 
                <b>Jake Phillips's</b> post
                was a total <i><b>non-sequitur</b></i>, <i>not</i> part of some ongoing logistical discussion about planning an attack on the Capitol.
                His post was indistinguishable from many of the 
                <a href="https://sigsegv1980.github.io/j6/ZenodoParlerPostsFromNovember2020ToJanuary2021WithKeywordStormTheCapitol_IncludingEchoes.html">hundreds of 
                knee-jerk Parler posts calling for
                Trump supporters to storm Capitol buildings</a> or other administrative buildings.
                Moreover, <b>Jake Phillips'</b> Telegram post quoted here occurred on January 3, 2021, merely <i>three days</i> before January 6th, yet <b>Jake Phillips</b> 
                asked about
                storming <i>“capitol buildings”</i> as if this was a novel idea raised for the first time. No other Proud Boys
                engaged with <b>Jake Phillips'</b> post and there were no replies or follow-ups.
                <br><br>
                More significantly, <b>Jake Phillips</b> wasn't even in Washington D.C. on January 6th and never even planned to go there in the first
                place. Instead, <a href="https://sigsegv1980.github.io/j6/JakePhillips-MessagesFromMOSDMain.html"><b>Jake Phillips</b> made plans to go to Columbus, Ohio on Jan 6,</a>
                to attend a 
                <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20210107074637/https://www.dispatch.com/story/news/local/2021/01/06/tempers-were-short-fists-flew-street-during-trump-rally/6565956002/">local 
                protest at the 
                <b>Ohio State Capitol building</b></a> with his chapter of Ohio Proud Boys. <b>Jake Phillips</b> didn't really even approve of the idea 
                of going to Washington DC on January 6th. 
                He argued that <a href="https://sigsegv1980.github.io/j6/ProudBoys-MOSD-MAIN-FullChatMessages-2020-12-27_2021-1-1.pdf#page=42">local State Capitol protests 
                would be more effective</a>
                and 
                <a href="https://sigsegv1980.github.io/j6/ProudBoys-MOSD-MAIN-FullChatMessages-2020-12-27_2021-1-1.pdf#page=43">easier to organize</a> 
                than one big national rally in Washington DC, and he barely participated in the planning for the Jan 6 rally.
                <br><br>
                So <b>Jake Phillips</b> was not in Washington DC on Jan 6, he never had plans to go there, he was not one of the
                <b>MOSD</b> leaders, and he was never arrested or charged with anything related to January 6th. Thus, <b>Jake Phillips'</b> non-sequitur remarks 
                about storming capitol buildings are mostly 
                irrelevant to the seditious conspiracy case. The prosecution selectively quoted <b>Jake Phillips</b> out of context to create the illusion that
                his remarks about the Capitol were part of some ongoing strategic planning discussion, rather than mere fanciful
                musings about an inspirational Facebook post. In reality,
                there was never <i>any</i> discussion about a plan to storm the Capitol in <i>any</i> of the Telegram chat groups
                relevant to the trial.

                This was included in the indictment because it's one of only a <i>handful</i> of instances, out of thousands of Telegram and Parler posts
                recovered by the FBI, where any Proud Boy actually said "storm the Capitol" (or any similar phrase) prior to
                January 6th, 2021. This paragraph of the indictment is <i><b>incredibly misleading</b></i> because it presents a quote
                from Proud Boy <b>Jake Phillips</b>, leader of the Ohio Proud Boys, without any context, and claims the quote was part of a conversation wherein
                the Proud Boys “<i>exchanged messages in the MOSD Members Group [containing] various statements about attacking the Capitol</i>”.
                This misleadingly implies that <b>Jake Phillips'</b> post was part of
                an <i>ongoing planning discussion</i> that was actually <i>about</i> the details of a plan to attack the Capitol building.
                <br><br>
                But when we <a href="https://sigsegv1980.github.io/j6/ProudBoys-MOSD-Main-2020-12-27_2021-1-4.pdf#page=23">read <b>Jake Phillips'</b> post in context</a>, we 
                immediately see that no such discussion ever happened. The <i>actual</i> topic of
                discussion was the <i><b>certification of Pennsylvania's electoral votes</b></i>, brought up originally by 
                a Proud Boy named “<b>Kbsman2</b>”.
                The post from <b>Jake Phillips</b>, rhetorically asking about storming the Capitol, was a complete <i><b>non-sequitur</b></i>.
                It was <i>not</i> part of any ongoing planning discussion about storming the Capitol, and there were no further follow-up posts
                after <b>Johnny Blackbeard's</b> terse reply. 
                <br><br>
                Moreover, this exchange took place on January 4, 2021, merely <i>two days</i>
                before Jan 6. Yet <b>Jake Phillips</b> rhetorically asked about storming the Capitol as if this were a novel idea
                brought up here for the first time. If the the prosecution's <i>seditious conspiracy case</i> holds any weight, the Proud Boys
                should have been finalizing the details of their plan to storm the Capitol by this point, and discussions about
                storming the Capitol should have dominated the <b>MOSD</b> Telegram chat groups. Instead, all we find
                are a handful of non-sequitur comments like this one, out of thousands of Telegram posts.
                <br><br>
                Even more significantly, this conversation involved three Proud Boys — <b>Kbsman2</b>, <b>Jake Phillips</b>, and <b>Johnny Blackbeard</b>, 
                <b><i>none of whom were even present in Washington DC on January 6th.</i></b> In fact, <b>Jake Phillips</b>, who first brought up the idea of storming

                protest in Columbus, Ohio on January 6th</a>. Similarly, <b>Kbsman2</b> and 
                <b>Johnny Blackbeard</b> were Pennsylvania Proud Boys who never showed up in DC on Jan 6 either. <b>Johnny Blackbeard</b> essentially

                <br><br>
                Moreover, of the three Proud Boys involved in this brief conversation, only <b>Johnny Blackbeard</b> (John Charles Stewart) was an upper-tier leader with any 
                real authority in the <b>MOSD</b> chapter, 
                and the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20221109232448/https://www.washingtonpost.com/dc-md-va/2022/10/28/proud-boys-jan6-stewart-tarrio/">only one 
                actually arrested and charged with anything</a>, 
                despite not even being present in DC on January 6th. Yet it was <b>Jake Phillips</b> — not Johnny Blackbeard — 
                who first brought up the idea of storming the Capitol. But <b>Jake Phillips</b> wasn’t in DC on January 6 either and was never arrested or implicated in the conspiracy. 
                <b>Jake Phillips</b> didn't even really approve of the Jan 6 rally in DC and was barely involved in planning it,
                arguing that smaller State Capitol protests would be

                large national rally. 
                But if <b>Jake Phillips’</b> Telegram post about storming the Capitol is supposed to be compelling evidence of a pre-planned seditious conspiracy, why was <b>Jake 
                Phillips</b> himself never arrested or charged?
                <br><br>
                Finally, it's entirely possible that <b>Jake Phillips</b> wasn't even referring to the US Capitol building here. At the time of these posts in early January of 2021, 
                the <b>"Stop the Steal"</b> movement was ongoing, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20201231183223/https://stopthesteal.us/">

                actually referring to <i><B>State Capitol buildings</b></i>.</a> Similarly, across all of

                he used the word “capital/capitol” 7 times, and 
                <a href="https://sigsegv1980.github.io/j6/JakePhillips-MessagesFromMOSDMainMentioningCapitol.html">5 out of 7 times he was clearly and 
                unambiguously talking about <b>State Capitol</b> buildings</a>. <b>Jake Phillips</b> also stated explicitly that he 
                <a href="https://sigsegv1980.github.io/j6/ProudBoys-MOSD-MAIN-FullChatMessages-2020-12-27_2021-1-1.pdf#page=42">preferred <b>State Capitol</b>

                <br><br>
                Thus, given that <b>Jake Phillips'</b> post about storming the Capitol was in reply to
                an earlier post from <b>Kbsman2</b> talking about Pennsylvania's electoral votes, it's quite plausible and even likely that <b>Jake Phillips</b>
                — who was <a href="https://sigsegv1980.github.io/j6/JakePhillips-MessagesFromMOSDMainMentioningCapitol.html">all about <b>State Capitol</b> rallies</a> — was 
                actually referring to the <i><b>Pennsylvania Capitol building in Harrisburg</b></i>. Indeed, 
                <a href="https://sigsegv1980.github.io/j6/ParlerPostsAboutPennsylvaniaCapitol-2021-01-01_2021-01-06.html">Senator <b>Pat Toomey's</b> certification of Pennsylvania's 
                electoral votes</a>
                was the subject of hundreds of Parler posts during the first week of January in 2021.
                And as it turns out, a contingent of Pennsylvania Proud Boys showed up
                at the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20210110194125/https://parler.com/post/b8350a9fdb7442458a2824f543fdc543">

                the Pennsylvania Capitol building</a> and claimed they "took the Capitol" (meaning they attended a legal protest at the Pennsylvania Capitol

                Thus, <b>Jake Phillips</b> was not in Washington DC on Jan 6, he never had plans to go there, he was not one of the <b>MOSD</b> leaders, and he was

                was mostly irrelevant to the <i>seditious conspiracy case</i>, and basically <i>indistinguishable</i> from many of the

                Included in the indictment because one Proud Boy, <b>John Charles Stewart (Johnny Blackbeard)</b>, mentions
                the Capitol building and recommends planning "<i>the operations base around the front entrance of the Capitol
                building</i>" and also recommends using the National Mall, because <i>"it's a wide open space, you can see
                everything coming from all angles."</i> This suggests to the reader that <b>Johnny Blackbeard's</b> comment is part of 
                a <i>planning</i> discussion wherein the Proud Boys were hashing out the details of their plan to storm the Capitol
                building. Again, the prosecution relies on the reader's natural <i><b>confirmation bias</b></i> to interpret any mention
                of the Capitol building or planning in general as evidence of a seditious conspiracy to storm the Capitol.
                <br><br>
                However, reading <a href="https://sigsegv1980.github.io/j6/ProudBoys-MOSDChat-2020-12-20_2021-1-4.pdf#page=32">the surrounding context</a> 
                reveals that the Proud Boys were simply talking about <i>event planning</i>. <b>Johnny Blackbeard</b>'s
                statement about the Capitol building was in response to <b>Enrique Tarrio's</b> voice message, where he said <i>"I'm getting so many 
                conflicting issues with, like, stages, locations, and times that, um, that I don't know where to put people."</i> But why was
                <b>Tarrio</b> concerned about <i>"like, stages locations, and times"</i>? <b>Enrique Tarrio</b> was concerned about these things
                because the Proud Boys had planned to attend the <a href="https://sigsegv1980.github.io/j6/Jan6MAGARallyMapGuideFull.pdf"><b>official events on Jan 6</b></a>, 
                because some Proud Boys had volunteered to work
                security for these events, and <b>Enrique Tarrio</b> was very likely booked as a guest speaker on Jan 6 at the 
                <a href="https://sigsegv1980.github.io/j6/LatinosForTrumpJan6Flyer.pdf"><b>“Latinos for Trump” stage</b></a>
                at “Area 7” (300 First Street NE) by the Capitol between 10 AM and 12 PM. This is why <b>Zach Rehl</b> asks <i>"Is
                [Enrique Tarrio] still doing a speech? Where is that?"</i>

                <b>Enrique Tarrio</b> was very likely scheduled to give a speech on Jan 6 at the <b>"Latinos for Trump"</b> stage near the Capitol building at “Area 7” (300 First Street NE) 
                between 10 AM and 12 PM. (See

                Florida State director</a> of Latinos for Trump.)
                <br><br>
                Therefore, since many of the official events for the Jan 6 rally were to 
                <a href="https://sigsegv1980.github.io/j6/USCapitolPolicePermitsForEventsNearCapitol.pdf">take place 
                near the Capitol building</a>, and 
                since multiple Proud Boys — including <b>George "Asher" Mesa</b> and some Proud Boys from <b>Tarrio's</b>
                chapter — were scheduled to work security at the “<b><a href="https://sigsegv1980.github.io/j6/LatinosForTrumpJan6Flyer.pdf">Latinos for Trump</a></b>” 
                stage by the Capitol building on Jan 6, <b>Johnny Blackbeard</b> recommended
                establishing "<i>the operations base</i>" by the Capitol building on the National Mall side. Obviously, the "<i>wide open space, [where] you can see everything 
                coming from all angles</i>" would make it easier for Proud Boys working security to detect threats from counter-protesters and secure the area around the stage.
                <br><br>
                Finally, <b>Johnny Blackbeard</b>'s concern about <i>“the signals coming out of D.C. Metro”</i> 
                reflected his fear that the DC Metropolitan Police might potentially arrest <b>Enrique Tarrio</b> or other Proud Boys on site, because of the

                Once again, the context surrounding these allegedly incriminating Telegram posts reveals that they're about <i>basic event planning</i>, 
                and have absolutely <i>nothing</i> to do with
                any secret plan to storm the Capitol.

                This Telegram post is one of the most <i>important</i> pieces of evidence for the prosecution's case.
                <b>Enrique Tarrio</b>, chairman of the Proud Boys, actually said the words <i>“<a href="TarrioSayingYouWantToStormTheCapitol.mp4"><b>storm the Capitol</b></a>”</i>
                on Telegram, two days before January 6th. 
                This is one of only <a href="https://sigsegv1980.github.io/j6/ProudBoys-TelegramMessagesWithStormTheCapitol.html"><i>five instances</i></a>, 
                across <i>thousands</i> of
                Telegram and Parler posts recovered by the FBI, where any Proud Boy actually said the phrase <i>“storm the Capitol”</i> (or any similar
                phrase), prior to January 6th, 2021. This is also the <i>only instance</i> where an actual upper-tier <b>MOSD leader</b> said this phrase. 
                Yet like all of the other four instances, this Telegram post does not demonstrate that the Proud Boys ever had an 
                <i>actual plan</i> to storm the Capitol.
                <br><br>
                <b>Enrique Tarrio's</b> comment was likely a reply to an 
                <a href="#anc23">earlier voice message</a> from <b>Johnny Blackbeard</b>.
                But <b>Tarrio's</b> comment here was a complete <b><i>non-sequitur</i></b>, 
                not part of any ongoing <i>planning</i> discussion about storming the Capitol, and there were no replies
                or follow-up posts that we know about. 
                Furthermore, <b>Enrique Tarrio</b> posted this on <i>January 4th</i>, a mere <i>two days</i> before Jan 6.
                But the prosecution argued that the conspiracy to storm the Capitol 
                <a href="https://sigsegv1980.github.io/j6/2023-08-17-USAvEthanNordeanAndJosephBiggsAndZacharyRehlAndEnriqueTarrioAndDominicPezzola-GovernmentSentencingMemorandum.pdf#page=38">began 
                as early as December 19th, 2020</a>.
                Intuitively, if the prosecution's <b>seditious conspiracy</b> case had any merit, any plans to storm the Capitol should have been nearly 
                finalized by January 4th, and should 
                have dominated the discussions in the <b>MOSD</b> Telegram group chats. Instead, all we have are a handful of isolated, <i>non-sequitur</i> comments like this, 
                with no specific details and no engagement from other Proud Boys.
                <br><br>
                But if there was no secret conspiracy to storm the Capitol, how do we explain <b>Enrique Tarrio's</b> post here?
                One possibility is that <b>Tarrio</b> was simply joking. But it's also possible Tarrio was actually seriously considering trying to storm the Capitol.
                He certainly <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20210110195804/https://parler.com/post/cd16d7922945425ebf1ace91abdcbef3">expressed approval and celebrated</a> 
                when hundreds of Trump supporters stormed the Capitol on
                January 6th. But again, there's simply no evidence that the Proud Boys actually <i>made plans in advance of Jan 6</i> to storm the Capitol. In 
                <b>Enrique Tarrio's</b> voice message (<a href="TarrioSayingYouWantToStormTheCapitol.mp4">listen for yourself</a>), 
                he says <i>“you want to storm the Capitol”</i> with a rising-falling intonation that suggests feigned bemusement.
                <br><br>
                But why would <b>Enrique Tarrio</b> joke about storming the Capitol, or even bring up such an idea, if the Proud Boys weren't already planning
                on storming the Capitol, or at least considering such a plan? Well, <b>Enrique Tarrio</b> wasn't operating in a vacuum. The idea of 
                <i>"storming the Capitol"</i> was very popular with the online MAGA-sphere at the time. From November 2020 through January 5th, 2021, there
                were around <a href="https://sigsegv1980.github.io/j6/ZenodoParlerPostsFromNovember2020ToJanuary2021WithKeywordStormTheCapitol_IncludingEchoes.html">
                <b>468 Parler posts</b> (including echoes) exhorting Trump supporters to <b>storm Capitol buildings</b></a> or other administrative centers, 
                averaging around <b>40,943</b> daily views. This includes calls to storm both State Capitol buildings and the US Capitol building
                in DC. 
                <br><br>
                In fact, <i>“storming the Capitol building”</i> doesn't even necessarily refer to a violent or illegal act. It can sometimes
                mean something like <i>"<b>occupying</b> the Capitol"</i>. For example, in November of 2020, Alex Jones <i><b>legally</b></i> led a contingent 
                of Trump supporters inside the Georgia State Capitol building, where they stood around with signs and chanted slogans before leaving 
                peacefully. Yet <i>The Gateway Pundit</i>, a conservative news outlet, reported that Jones led a 
                <i>“<a href="https://www.thegatewaypundit.com/2020/11/happening-now-alex-jones-leading-crowd-trump-supporters-storming-georgia-state-capitol-video/"><b>Crowd 
                of Trump Supporters Storming [the] Georgia State Capitol</b></a>”</i>.
                Some journalists on Twitter also referred to this completely legal demonstration as 
                <i>“<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20201118174048/https://twitter.com/BGOnTheScene/status/1329116419037024273"><b>storm[ing] the Capitol</b></a>”</i> as well.
                <br><br>
                Clearly, the phrase <i>“storm the Capitol”</i> was sometimes used in the sense of <i>“<b>occupy</b> the Capitol”</i> — suggesting a more legitimate form of
                political protest rather than a violent insurrection. Indeed, the phrase 
                <i>“<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20201223232959/https://twitter.com/QellyAnon/status/1341888628260106240"><b>occupy the Capitol</b></a>”</i>, or some 
                variation of it, appeared
                <a href="https://sigsegv1980.github.io/j6/ParlerPostsUsingOccupyLikeProgressives_2020_IncludingEchoes.html">on Parler around <b>3,450</b>
                times</a> from November 2020 through January 5th, 2021. The concept of “storming” or “occupying” Capitol buildings was 
                a <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20201129230834/https://twitter.com/MichaelCoudrey/status/1333185954626953217">prevalent feature</a> of the ethos surrounding the 
                “<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20201231183223/https://stopthesteal.us/"><b>Stop the Steal</b></a>” movement in late 2020, which centered largely around
                <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20201110195210/https://parler.com/profile/AlexJones/posts">State Capitol buildings</a> across the US. 
                Indeed, a 
                <a href="https://sigsegv1980.github.io/j6/2020-12-30-SecretServiceProtectiveIntelligenceBriefOnJan6.pdf"><b>US Secret Service</b> intelligence
                briefing released a week before January 6th</a> reported on a pro-Trump movement <i>“to occupy Capitol Hill”</i>
                supported by “<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20201231183223/https://stopthesteal.us/"><b>Stop The Steal</b></a>” organizers like 
                <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20210105132318/https://twitter.com/ali/status/1346447147508621313">Ali Alexander</a>.
                Thus, whether or not the Proud Boys <i>actually</i> had a secret plan to storm the Capitol, it's very likely they would have 
                at least been <i>exposed to the idea</i> via social osmosis. It's therefore not at all <i>unlikely</i> that the Proud Boys
                would find occasion to joke about it.

                instances among the Telegram evidence</a> 
                where a Proud Boy said the phrase <i>“storm the Capitol”</i> (or something similar) are mostly non-sequiturs and 
                basically indistinguishable from many
                of the 
                <a href="https://sigsegv1980.github.io/j6/ZenodoParlerPostsFromNovember2020ToJanuary2021WithKeywordStormTheCapitol_IncludingEchoes.html">hundreds of 
                knee-jerk Parler posts calling for
                Trump supporters to storm Capitols</a> or other buildings, not to mention
                <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20200208031638/https://twitter.com/RealSavySuave/status/1225619390093238273">similar calls to <i>“storm the Capitol”</i></a>

                <br><br>
                Of course, Telegram posts from the Proud Boys containing the phrase <i>“storm the Capitol”</i> arguably deserve
                <i>more</i> scrutiny than similar posts from random Trump supporters on Parler, because some Proud Boys actually <i><b>did</b></i> 
                storm the Capitol on January 6th. But then again, so did hundreds of random Trump supporters. Interestingly,
                the <a href="https://sigsegv1980.github.io/j6/ProudBoys-TelegramMessagesWithStormTheCapitol.html"><i>only</i> two Proud Boys who 
                actually said the phrase <i>“storm the Capitol”</i></a> on Telegram (i.e. <b>Enrique Tarrio</b> and <b>Jake Phillips</b>)
                were not even <i>present</i> in Washington DC on January 6th. Therefore, their Telegram posts containing the phrase 
                <i>“storm the Capitol”</i> arguably have little more weight than the hundreds of similar posts from random Trump supporters, with
                <b>Enrique Tarrio's</b> leadership role perhaps providing justification for some additional
                scrutiny.
                <br><br>
                Regardless, none of these Telegram posts constitute evidence of <i>actual planning</i>, and ultimately there's no evidence the Proud Boys
                planned the Capitol riot <i>in advance</i>. In fact,
                there's a <a href="ProudBoys-ExculpatoryChats.html">large body of <i><b>exculpatory evidence</b></i></a> to the contrary.
                For example, on January 2, 2021, just 2 days before <b>Tarrio</b> posted this voice message on Telegram, <b>Tarrio</b> posted 
                <a href="https://sigsegv1980.github.io/j6/ProudBoys-MOSDChat-2020-12-20_2021-1-4.pdf#page=31">another voice message
                in the <b>MOSD Leadership</b> group chat</a> (Government Exhibit <b>501-53</b>) in response to a Tweet someone posted accusing the Proud Boys of 
                planning to break into Federal buildings on January 6th. <b>Enrique Tarrio</b>
                joked about the implausibility of this, sarcastically pointing out that the Proud Boys could <i>barely</i> even march in formation 
                correctly, and were therefore not even <i>remotely capable</i> of doing something as “cool” as storming a Federal building:

                The above Telegram conversation is yet another piece of strong <b>exculpatory evidence</b>. These posts
                occurred in a <i>private</i> Telegram group chat that the Proud Boys believed to be secure at the time. It is therefore

                of orchestrating an attack on the US Capitol building. It is therefore highly likely that when <b>Tarrio</b> said

                Perhaps <b>Tarrio</b> even intended the joke as a “call back” to the earlier 
                conversation on January 2nd, where <b>Tarrio</b> and <b>Johnny Blackbeard</b> exchanged sarcastic remarks about
                <i>“how fucking retarded our members are”</i>.

                Included in the indictment because it shows the Proud Boys were trying to hide something when 
                they considered deleting messages from the <b>MOSD</b> Telegram chat group after <b>Enrique Tarrio</b> 
                was <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20220712213106/https://twitter.com/maustermuhle/status/1346521554855874565">
                <b>arrested</b> shortly after arriving in DC</a> on January 4th, 2021. The Proud Boys
                feared that law enforcement would gain access to the private <b>MOSD</b>
                Telegram chat group after confiscating <b>Enrique Tarrio's</b> phone. Additionally, <b>Charles Donohoe's</b> statement
                <i>“at least they won't get our boots on ground plans”</i> implies the Proud Boys made certain
                plans that they were trying to keep hidden from law enforcement. Basic <i><b>confirmation bias</b></i> may lead some readers
                to assume that <b>Donohoe</b> was referring to secret plans to storm the Capitol building.
                <br><br>
                During the conspiracy trial, the jury considered this talk of deleting messages to be
                <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20241116131429/https://www.vice.com/en/article/enrique-tarrio-proud-boys-jury/">strong evidence of guilt</a>. 
                Of course, the complete lack of any direct evidence of 
                advance planning to storm the Capitol should have been sufficient for a "not guilty" verdict based on reasonable doubt. 
                Nonetheless, it's certainly fair to ask: if the Proud Boys
                really <i>didn't</i> make plans prior to Jan 6 to storm the Capitol, then <b><i>why</i></b> did they act as if they
                had something to hide? Why were they so afraid that the cops might read their Telegram chats? 
                If the Proud Boys merely planned on coming to DC to attend the rally, then what exactly were they afraid of? 
                Why was <b>Charles Donohoe</b> so
                concerned about the cops finding out about their “boots on ground” plans?

                Firstly, the <a href="https://sigsegv1980.github.io/j6/ProudBoys-NewMOSD-2021-1-4_2021-1-13.pdf#page=5">surrounding context</a> (omitted from the indictment) 
                reveals that the Proud Boys actually
                <i><b>didn't</b></i> bother to delete any messages from the <b>MOSD</b> group chat. 
                <b>Aaron Wolkin</b> expressed the opinion (excluded from the indictment) that deleting messages was a <i>“waste of time”</i>,
                because (according to <b>Wolkin</b>) <i>“Google and apple key log everything that you type into your phone anyways”</i>.
                <b>Zach Rehl</b> added that permanently erasing Telegram messages from the server would be a cumbersome process. Regardless, even 
                if the Proud Boys were too lazy to
                actually delete any messages, they were still clearly distressed over the possibility that 
                law enforcement might read their private Telegram chats after 
                <a href="https://sigsegv1980.github.io/j6/ProudBoys-NewMOSD-2021-1-4_2021-1-13.pdf#page=3">confiscating <b>Enrique Tarrio</b>'s phone</a>.
                <br><br>
                This is best explained by the fact that the Proud Boys leadership had a strong 
                <a href="https://sigsegv1980.github.io/j6/ProudBoys-MOSDProspectsSmall.pdf"><b>OPSEC</b> (operational security) ethos</a>,
                and there are numerous reasons why the Proud Boys would want to prevent their private chats from falling into the hands of
                law enforcement aside from any secret plans to storm the US Capitol. While the 
                <a href="#anc13">Proud Boys' <i>actual</i> plan for
                January 6th</a> mostly involved <i><b>legal</b></i> activities like attending 
                <a href="https://sigsegv1980.github.io/j6/Jan6MAGARallyMapGuideFull.pdf"><b>the official events</b></a>, giving speeches,
                working security details, and <a href="https://youtu.be/oSOsG5kN5wc?t=966">

                regularly discussed
                <b><i>illegal</i></b> activities on Telegram, like bringing 
                <a href="https://sigsegv1980.github.io/j6/ProudBoys-ExportedTelegramChatMOSDOp/messages.html#go_to_message532">restricted weapons to DC</a>
                and getting into

                <br><br>
                The Proud Boys
                used the umbrella term “<b>Antifa</b>” to refer to various regional <i>anti-fascist</i> or anarchist 
                collectives (called <a href="https://sigsegv1980.github.io/ndaa-domestic-terrorism-strategic-report.pdf#page=6">“Anarchist Violent Extremists” by the <b>FBI</b></a>),

                The Proud Boys expected to fight <b>Antifa</b> on the streets of DC on January 6 after dark, just as they did during the previous two MAGA
                rallies in DC <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20201115050711/https://www.nytimes.com/2020/11/14/us/politics/thousands-rally-in-washington-as-clashes-erupt.html">on November 14th</a>

                predicted that violent street fighting

                in December of 2020: <i>“[I]ndividuals who self-identify with the <b>Antifa</b> identity ... [are] the main opposition group
                where historically the most violent action originates. These individuals are

                November demonstrations.”</i>
                <br><br>
                The Proud Boys sometimes used the phrase <i>“<b>in minecraft</b>”</i> or <i>“<b>playing minecraft</b>”</i> as a euphemism for 
                doing something violent or illegal. They often used this phrase
                when discussing their plans to fight with <b>Antifa</b>. For example, the following exchange took place on Telegram

                around <b>690</b> individual posts, there was not a <i>single mention</i> of any plans to attack police or storm the Capitol. (The
                Capitol building was <a href="https://sigsegv1980.github.io/j6/ProudBoys-ExportedTelegramChatMOSDOp/messages.html#go_to_message546">mentioned only once</a>, 
                when somebody brought up the Hyatt Hotel near the Capitol building.) The discussion
                was focused almost entirely on <a href="https://sigsegv1980.github.io/j6/ProudBoys-ExportedTelegramChatMOSDOp/messages.html#go_to_message502">combat strategies</a>,
                <a href="https://sigsegv1980.github.io/j6/ProudBoys-ExportedTelegramChatMOSDOp/messages.html#go_to_message532">weapons</a>,

                <br><br>
                Secondly, these discussions make it abundantly clear <i>why</i> the Proud Boys would <i>not</i> have wanted law enforcement
                to read their private Telegram chats. The Proud Boys discussed many <i><b>illegal</b></i> or border-line illegal activities, such as 
                <a href="https://sigsegv1980.github.io/j6/ProudBoys-ExportedTelegramChatMOSDOp/messages.html#go_to_message532">bringing
                restricted weapons into Washington DC</a>, using 
                <a href="https://sigsegv1980.github.io/j6/ProudBoys-ExportedTelegramChatMOSDOp/messages.html#go_to_message494">laser pointers that will “burn your eye out”</a>, 
                using a “<a href="https://sigsegv1980.github.io/j6/ProudBoys-ExportedTelegramChatMOSDOp/messages.html#go_to_message500">mini-flamethrower</a>”,
                as well as various comments about <a href="https://sigsegv1980.github.io/j6/ProudBoys-ExportedTelegramChatMOSDOp/messages.html#go_to_message489">knocking 
                out or otherwise assaulting</a> 
                <b>Antifa</b> members. 
                One Proud Boy even <a href="https://sigsegv1980.github.io/j6/ProudBoys-MOSDChat-2020-12-20_2021-1-4.pdf#page=25">admitted to <i><b>assaulting a police officer</b></i> during
                a previous rally</a>.
                On top of this, these group chats
                also contained <a href="https://sigsegv1980.github.io/j6/ProudBoys-ExportedTelegramChatMOSDOp/messages.html#go_to_message292">offensive jokes and memes</a>, 
                <a href="https://sigsegv1980.github.io/j6/ProudBoys-ExportedTelegramChatMOSDOp/messages.html#go_to_message8">slurs</a>, 
                and posts <a href="https://sigsegv1980.github.io/j6/ProudBoys-ExportedTelegramChatMOSDOp/messages.html#go_to_message600">glorifying violence</a> with various degrees of
                sincerity. All of this suggests some pretty compelling reasons for the Proud Boys to have wanted to keep
                their private Telegram chats away from the prying eyes of law enforcement.
                <br><br>
                If all that wasn't enough of a reason, the Proud Boys also became very

                distrustful of the DC police</a> following the December 12th

                Proud Boy <b>John Charles Stewart</b> (a.k.a. <b>Johnny Blackbeard</b>) expressed concern that DC Metro police officers may try to 
                ambush individual Proud Boys in DC “<i>from a fucking side street</i>” and arrest them on site.
                The earlier <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20220712213106/https://twitter.com/maustermuhle/status/1346521554855874565">arrest of <b>Enrique Tarrio</b></a> on

                It is therefore quite easy to understand why the Proud Boys would want to prevent
                law enforcement from reading their private Telegram chats, regardless of whether the Proud Boys actually had any secret plans
                to storm the Capitol or not.

                a <i>Black Lives Matter</i> banner</a>
                belonging to a church during the previous MAGA rally in DC on December 12th, 2020. The prosecution
                interpreted whatever <b>Charles Donohoe</b>
                meant by <i>“gang charges”</i> as a <i>damning admission</i> that the Proud Boys were involved in
                a <b>seditious conspiracy</b> to storm the Capitol.
                <br><br>
                Some of the context surrounding <b>Donohoe's</b> statement is likely missing from the available Telegram extractions. However,
                there is enough context to make it clear that the topic of discussion was Proud Boy Chairman
                <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20220712213106/https://twitter.com/maustermuhle/status/1346521554855874565"><b>Enrique Tarrio</b>'s arrest</a> 
                after arriving in DC on January 4, 2021. It's likely that <b>Charles Donohoe</b> was actually thinking
                about the potential charges against <b>Enrique Tarrio</b>, rather than 
                <b>conspiracy</b> charges against the Proud Boys as a group, when he said <i>“we can be looking at Gang charges”</i>.
                This becomes more plausible when the surrounding context is considered, particularly the subsequent discussion
                about federal charges beginning with the post from <b>Dick Sweats</b> saying: <i>“We all need to see what [Tarrio] has been charged with
                first”</i>.
                <br><br>
                Initially, some media outlets reported that <b>Tarrio's</b> burning of the BLM banner would be

                the <a href="https://sigsegv1980.github.io/j6/ShaneLamondAndEnriqueTarrioMessagesAndCommunications.pdf#page=50">hate crime angle never gained much traction</a>.

                Initially, <b>Tarrio</b> was to be charged with a 
                <a href="https://sigsegv1980.github.io/j6/ShaneLamondAndEnriqueTarrioMessagesAndCommunications.pdf">misdemeanor for destruction of property</a>
                for burning the BLM flag.
                But when he was arrested in DC, <b>Tarrio</b> was also found to be 
                <a href="https://sigsegv1980.github.io/j6/ProudBoys-EnriqueTarrioArrestAffidavit-BLMBannerBurning.pdf">in possession of two empty firearm magazines</a>.
                It's unclear how the <i>“gang charges”</i> mentioned by <b>Charles Donohoe</b> entered the picture, but perhaps <b>Tarrio's</b> lawyer,
                aware of the politics behind <b>Tarrio's</b> arrest, floated this possibility at some point.
                By "gang charges" <b>Charles Donohoe</b> was likely referring to something like
                <a href="https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/18/521"><b>18 U.S. Code § 521</b></a>, 
                a federal law code allowing for increased sentences for certain crimes (drug trafficking, violence, etc.) 
                committed by members of a “<a href="https://www.law.cornell.edu/definitions/uscode.php?width=840&height=800&iframe=true&def_id=18-USC-1437752877-320030390&term_occur=999&term_src=title:18:part:I:chapter:26:section:521">criminal street gang</a>”.
                Perhaps the fear was that a DC prosecutor might try to argue that the Proud Boys as an organization
                meets the legal definition of a violent “criminal street gang” based on a history
                of fighting counter-protesters, thereby significantly increasing
                the severity of the charges against <b>Tarrio</b>.
                <br><br>
                The Proud Boys were also concerned that the
                DC police would <a href="https://sigsegv1980.github.io/j6/ProudBoys-NewMOSD-2021-1-4_2021-1-13.pdf#page=3">confiscate <b>Tarrio's phone</b></a> 
                and gain access to private Telegram
                group chats like <b>MOSD</b>. To prevent this from happening, <b>Charles Donohoe</b>,
                with help from other Proud Boys, led a mass exodus from the <b>MOSD</b> Telegram group chats (including 
                <a href="https://sigsegv1980.github.io/j6/ProudBoys-MOSDChat-2020-12-20_2021-1-4.pdf"><b>MOSD</b></a>,
                <a href="https://sigsegv1980.github.io/j6/ProudBoys-MOSD-MAIN-FullChatMessages-2020-12-27_2021-1-1.pdf"><b>MOSD MAIN</b></a>
                and <a href="https://sigsegv1980.github.io/j6/ProudBoys-ExportedTelegramChatMOSDOp/messages.html"><b>MOSD Ops</b></a>)
                and created new replacement group chats such as
                <a href="https://sigsegv1980.github.io/j6/ProudBoys-NewMOSD-2021-1-4_2021-1-13.pdf"><b>New MOSD</b></a> and

                <br><br>
                During the conspiracy trial, the prosecution implied that the primary reason the Proud Boys
                wanted to conceal their private Telegram chats from law enforcement was because the Proud Boys were
                secretly planning to storm the Capitol on January 6th. But there is no evidence that the Proud Boys made
                any such plan in advance of Jan 6, and there are <a href="#anc26">numerous <i>other</i> reasons</a> 
                the Proud Boys would have wanted to conceal their private chats from law enforcement. 
                <br><br>
                While the Proud Boys 
                most likely did <i>not</i> 
                conspire in advance to storm the Capitol, they certainly <i>did</i> plan on doing various <i><b>illegal</b></i> or border-line
                illegal things in Washington DC that they discussed openly on Telegram. This included
                <a href="https://sigsegv1980.github.io/j6/ProudBoys-ExportedTelegramChatMOSDOp/messages.html#go_to_message532">
                illegally bringing restricted weapons</a> into Washington DC in anticipation of
                <a href="https://sigsegv1980.github.io/j6/ProudBoys-ExportedTelegramChatMOSDOp/messages.html#go_to_message489">violent street fights with <b>Antifa</b></a>.
                The Proud Boys also discussed using weapons such as
                <a href="https://sigsegv1980.github.io/j6/ProudBoys-ExportedTelegramChatMOSDOp/messages.html#go_to_message493">gel pepper
                spray</a> and a “<a href="https://sigsegv1980.github.io/j6/ProudBoys-ExportedTelegramChatMOSDOp/messages.html#go_to_message500">mini flamethrower</a>”
                against <b>Antifa</b>.
                One Proud Boy even <a href="https://sigsegv1980.github.io/j6/ProudBoys-MOSDChat-2020-12-20_2021-1-4.pdf#page=25">admitted to <b>assaulting a police officer</b> at
                a previous rally</a>. There were many such private discussions on Telegram about doing illegal things 
                <i>“<a href="https://sigsegv1980.github.io/j6/ProudBoys-MOSD-Main-2020-12-27_2021-1-4.pdf#page=7">in minecraft</a>”</i>. Therefore,
                the Proud Boys had <i>very good reasons</i> to want to keep their private Telegram chats away from the prying eyes of law enforcement, regardless of
                whether or not the Proud Boys truly had a secret plan to storm the Capitol.

                Included in the indictment because it establishes that the Proud Boys had some form of a plan on Jan 6, and
                they used hand-held radios (<a href="https://www.baofengradio.com/">Baofeng radios</a>) to coordinate. The prosecution
                framed any evidence of preparation or planning, including the use of communication equipment, as evidence
                of a secret plan to storm the Capitol devised in advance of Jan 6. 
                (See 
                <a href="https://sigsegv1980.github.io/j6/2022-06-06-USAvEthanNordeanAndJosephBiggsAndZacharyRehlAndEnriqueTarrioAndDominicPezzola-ThirdSupersedingIndictment.pdf#page=8">paragraph 
                28 of the indictment</a>.)
                <br><br>
                The prosecution's argument that <i>any</i> evidence of planning in general is also <i>specifically</i> evidence 
                of a pre-planned <b>seditious conspiracy</b> to storm the Capitol is completely fallacious. The Proud Boys routinely made plans
                and used communication equipment when attending rallies. These plans generally took the form of an itinerary
                for the day before the rally, including a pre-rally security brief, and an itinerary for
                the day of the rally itself, which included rules for interacting with the public and recruiting new members, 
                a day-time march through the streets,
                and sometimes a night march as well.
                <br><br>
                When the Proud Boys mentioned their <i>"plans"</i> for Jan 6 on Telegram, they were referring to a similarly mundane itinerary.
                For an example of an <b>ACTUAL</b> Proud Boy plan/itinerary for a rally
                before January 6, see the <a href="https://sigsegv1980.github.io/j6/ProudBoys-EastCoastRallyCommandChat.pdf#page=2"><b>official plans/itinerary for the December 12, 2020 rally</b></a>

                        2. We are not a fucking militia. Do not act

                        3. Do not patrol the streets. Always follow

                        up with BLM and Antifa….YOU DONT<br><br>
                        7. These rules too much for you….STAY

                        8. At this point you have chosen to put

                Note the similarities between this plan/itinerary for the December 12 rally and what little we know of the Jan 6 rally plan. 
                Firstly, most of the same people involved with planning the December 12 rally later went on
                to join the <b>MOSD</b> chapter where they would help plan for Jan 6. Both rallies also involved
                a day-time march through Washington DC. During the planning for both rallies, <b>Enrique Tarrio</b> emphasized
                rules for interacting with the public and rules about wearing
                official club colors. Notably, in the above-quoted plans for December 12, <b>Enrique Tarrio</b> issued strict rules addressing behavior and discipline,
                ordering the Proud Boys to follow the itinerary and stay together, to always act <i>"IN SELF DEFENSE"</i>, 
                and not to speak to the media but also not to actively prevent the media from doing their job. This is all
                very similar to the topics discussed during the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9HY3IVStIJc"><b>MOSD Zoom meeting</b></a> 
                (see <a href="https://sigsegv1980.github.io/j6/ProudBoys-2020-12-30-MOSDZoomMeetingTranscript.pdf">transcript</a>) a week before the January 6 rally. It's obvious
                that seeds of the <b>Ministry of Self Defense (MOSD)</b> chapter were already forming in <b>Tarrio's</b> mind even before the December 12 rally,
                as he already seemed frustrated over behavioral/disciplinary issues, emphasizing the need to stay together and
                act defensively <i>before</i> the <b>MOSD</b> chapter existed.
                <br><br>
                Unfortunately, no similarly detailed itinerary for the Jan 6 rally was found among the Telegram evidence. But we
                don't need such an itinerary, because
                <b>Enrique Tarrio</b> <i>clearly</i> explained the <i>true plan</i> for the Jan 6 rally: 
                to <b><i>field test</i></b> the new <b>MOSD</b> chapter — to take it for a spin out in the streets of DC and test the new command structure
                to see if it worked as anticipated. 
                This is consistent with <b>Tarrio's</b> description of the plan for Jan 6
                as a <i>“<a href="https://sigsegv1980.github.io/j6/ProudBoys-MOSD-MAIN-FullChatMessages-2020-12-27_2021-1-1.pdf#page=118"><b>training exercise</b></a>”</i>
                and
                <b>Charles Donohoe</b>'s
                description of the plan for Jan 6 as 
                <i>“<a href="https://sigsegv1980.github.io/j6/ProudBoys-ExportedTelegramChatMOSDOp/messages.html#go_to_message441"><b>a simple and quick mission</b></a>”</i>.
                The objective was to hold a daytime march, navigating the streets 
                of DC as a cohesive, disciplined, well-oiled infantry, 
                <a href="https://youtu.be/9HY3IVStIJc?t=1019">divided into 10 man squads</a>, while remaining 
                close together as a <i>“<a href="https://youtu.be/9HY3IVStIJc?t=1051"><b>nucleus</b></a>”</i> — that is, 
                as <i>“<a href="https://youtu.be/9HY3IVStIJc?t=1460"><b>one fucking unit</a></b>”</i>:

                This is also consistent with <b>Enrique Tarrio's</b> announcement posted on December 29, 2020, in the 
                <a href="https://sigsegv1980.github.io/j6/ProudBoys-MOSD-MAIN-FullChatMessages-2020-12-27_2021-1-1.pdf#page=194"><b>MOSD MAIN</b> Telegram group</a>, where he said 
                <i>“we are going to be <b>using the 6th as a test</b> [of the new MOSD chapter]”</i>.
                <br><br>
                Thus, the Proud Boys' <i>true</i> plan for Jan 6 is no mystery. <b>Enrique Tarrio</b> directly explained the objective during the 
                <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9HY3IVStIJc"><b>MOSD Zoom call on December 30, 2020</b></a>

                nothing to do with any <b>seditious conspiracy</b> to attack the Capitol.
                <br><br>
                However, while the Proud Boys' overall plan for January 6 is clear, an exact
                itinerary for the January 6 rally that includes things like precise marching routes (similar to 
                the <a href="https://sigsegv1980.github.io/j6/ProudBoys-EastCoastRallyCommandChat.pdf"><b>itinerary for the December 12th rally</b></a>

                because <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20220712213106/https://twitter.com/maustermuhle/status/1346521554855874565">
                <b>Enrique Tarrio was arrested</b> on January 4th, 2021</a>, throwing the Proud Boys' pre-rally planning

                <b>Johnny Blackbeard</b> posted a voice message in the <b>New MOSD</b> Telegram group</a> (Govt Exhibit <b>509-30</b>), addressing the

                It's clear that on the morning of January 6th, many Proud Boys perceived a major lack of leadership and direction, and decided to
                act autonomously, going off to march on their own. Additionally, one Proud Boy 
                felt that the plans for Jan 6 were basically <i>“<b>a mirror</b>”</i> of the plan for December 12th. The 
                <a href="https://sigsegv1980.github.io/j6/ProudBoys-EastCoastRallyCommandChat.pdf#page=2">plan for December 12th</a>,
                quoted above in full, was basically just to 
                <a href="https://sigsegv1980.github.io/j6/CindyChafian-December12PermitForWomenForAmericaFirst.pdf">march from <b>Freedom Plaza</b> to the Supreme Court</a>.
                <br><br>
                It's clear that while the <b>MOSD</b> leaders probably came up with some itinerary or plan for Jan 6, most likely
                involving one or more marches around DC like the previous rally on December 12, the details of this
                plan were very poorly communicated. As late as <b>11:12 AM</b> on January 6, less than <i>two hours</i> before the
                Capitol riot began, the <b>MOSD</b> leadership was <i>still</i>
                struggling to communicate a coherent plan:

                This conversation occurred less than <i>two hours</i> before Trump supporters began storming the
                Capitol on Jan 6. And yet Proud Boy <b>Aaron Wolkind</b>, one of the leaders and chief organizers
                of the <b>MOSD</b> chapter, <i>still</i> didn't even know the exact plan. Meanwhile, <b>Johnny Blackbeard</b>,
                another <b>MOSD</b> leader, expressed concerned about groups of Proud Boys going off on their own due to a lack
                of leadership, while <b>Zach Rehl</b> was <i>“doing our thing”</i> with the <b>MOSD</b> Proud Boys on the ground in DC. 
                It <i>strains credulity</i> to believe these

                Thus, the Telegram evidence paints a picture of confusion, lack of leadership, and

                to the prosecution's <b>seditious conspiracy</b> case.

                after <b>Joe Biggs</b> said <i>“we have a plan”</i>, no specific details were discussed or revealed, at least not on Telegram.
                Instead, the <b>MOSD</b> Proud Boys agreed that everyone should meet at the Washington Monument
                at 10 AM the next morning (the morning of Jan 6), where further details

                Thus, while the indictment selectively quoted Telegram posts to suggest the Proud Boys had some secret
                plan to storm the Capitol that they devised in advance of Jan 6, there is simply <i>no evidence</i> that 
                any such plan existed. The 
                Telegram evidence suggests that <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20220712213106/https://twitter.com/maustermuhle/status/1346521554855874565"><b>Enrique Tarrio's</b> arrest</a>

                Included in the indictment because <b>Joe Biggs</b> said <i>“tomorrow's the day”</i> on January 5th, 2021, suggesting
                that the Proud Boys had some <i>“big plans”</i> for January 6th. Yet again, no actual details about tomorrow's 
                <i>“big plans”</i> were mentioned. The prosecution
                relied on the reader's natural <b>confirmation bias</b> to interpret <i>any</i> mention
                of a plan or planning in general as evidence <i>specifically</i> of a secret plan to storm the Capitol.

                the full context of <b>Joe Biggs'</b> post reveals that whatever plan the <b>MOSD</b> leadership had for January 6, it was devised at the 
                last minute and very poorly communicated to other <b>MOSD</b> members. 
                <b>Joe Biggs</b> hinted at some sort of plan for Jan 6 after one of the rank-and-file Proud Boys
                complained there was <i>“no fuckin plan either“</i>. Yet no specific details of this plan were divulged on Telegram, and 
                later that evening and on the day of January 6 itself as
                late as <b>12:00 noon</b> (less than <i>one hour</i> before the Capitol began), <b>MOSD</b> leaders were
                <i>still</i> asking basic questions about <i>“the plan”</i> and warning about a lack of leadership (see

                This is included in the indictment simply to reiterate that <b>Dominic Pezzola</b> was
                a member of the <b>MOSD</b> chapter. The prosecution believed it was important to emphasize this,
                because they also claimed that the <i>first</i> rioters to enter the Capitol building
                entered through a broken window that <b>Dominic Pezzola</b> smashed with a riot shield.
                <br><br>
                <b>Dominic Pezzola</b>'s defense admitted that he smashed a window using a riot shield,
                but <a href="2023-08-06-USAvDominicPezzola-DefendantPezzolasReplyToUnitedStatesResponseToPezzolaRule29and33Motions.pdf">
                denied that <b>Pezzola</b> was the first person to actually breach the Capitol building</a> on Jan 6, claiming that an unidentified individual wearing a red cap, 
                glasses and a red sweater first shattered the window. (The truth in this case is nuanced and perhaps open to interpretation: see 
                the <a href="#anc16">above analysis of <b>paragraph 39 of the indictment</b></a>.)
                <br><br>
                <b>Dominic Pezzola</b> was a rank-and-file member of the <b>MOSD</b>, not a <b>MOSD</b> leader. <b>Pezzola</b> joined the Proud Boys less than <i>two months</i> before 
                Jan 6 (see <a href="https://sigsegv1980.github.io/j6/2023-04-05-USAvProudBoys-TranscriptOfJuryTrial-Day60.pdf#page=82">trial testimony of Lisa Magee</a>).
                Pezzola was not a member of the <b>MOSD</b> leadership group chat, and only joined 
                <b>MOSD MAIN</b> — the Telegram group chat
                for rank-and-file Proud Boys — on the evening of January 2nd, a mere 
                <a href="https://sigsegv1980.github.io/j6/ProudBoys-MOSD-Main-2020-12-27_2021-1-4.pdf#page=18"><i>four days</i> before January 6th</a>.
                Furthermore, <b>Dominic Pezzola</b> ("Spazzo - 2nd°" on Telegram) barely posted anything at all on Telegram. Only 
                <a href="https://sigsegv1980.github.io/j6/ProudBoys-MOSD-Main-2020-12-27_2021-1-4.pdf#page=18"><i>three</i> posts from 
                <b>Pezzola</b></a> appear among the <b>MOSD MAIN</b> Exhibits, and all three
                are just hellos and greetings. In the <a href="https://sigsegv1980.github.io/j6/ProudBoys-BootsOnTheGroundChat.pdf"><b>Boots on the Ground</b> Telegram chat group</a> 
                <b>Dominic Pezzola</b> only posted <i>twice</i> (at least among the available exhibits): once to say <i>“Just arrived”</i>
                (Govt Exhibit <a href="https://sigsegv1980.github.io/j6/ProudBoys-BootsOnTheGroundChat.pdf#page=2"><b>512-3</b></a>)
                and another time to say <i>“Anybody need coms programmed hit me up”</i> 
                (Govt Exhibit <a href="https://sigsegv1980.github.io/j6/ProudBoys-BootsOnTheGroundChat.pdf#page=6"><b>512-4</b></a>).
                <br><br>
                If it weren't for the fact that <b>Dominic Pezzola</b> <i>happened</i> to be one of the first rioters to breach the Capitol building on
                January 6th, the prosecution likely would not have even bothered to include him in the indictment. Ultimately, <b>Dominic Pezzola</b> was
                the only Proud Boy acquitted of the <b><i>seditious conspiracy</i></b> charge.

                Included in the indictment because it establishes that the Proud Boys had <i>some</i> sort of plan
                on January 6th, and that one component of this plan involved meeting at the <b>Washington Monument</b>
                at 10 AM on the morning of January 6, without dressing in official Proud Boy 
                club colors. This paragraph of the indictment is one of several paragraphs that selectively
                quotes Telegram posts to misleadingly imply that the Proud Boys had some
                secret, detailed plan to storm the Capitol, devised in advance of Jan 6.
                <br><br>
                But the full context reveals firstly that no actual details of this “plan” were ever divulged
                on Telegram, beyond the initial meeting location. Certainly, nothing
                about a plan to storm the Capitol was ever mentioned. Secondly, the full context reveals
                there was
                significant confusion regarding the “plan” and a general lack of clarity and direction throughout the morning
                of January 6th, 2021.

                on January 4th</a>, the <b>MOSD</b> chapter fell into disarray and the

                was partially abandoned:

                It's clear that at this point, the rank-and-file Proud Boys in the <b>MOSD</b> chapter had 
                <a href="https://sigsegv1980.github.io/j6/ProudBoys-BootsOnTheGroundChat.pdf#page=5">no idea about
                any specific plans</a> for Jan 6. But even the senior <b>MOSD</b> leaders like <b>Joe Biggs</b> and <b>Jeremy Bertino</b> 
                were not exactly on the same page
                about the plan for Jan 6. During the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9HY3IVStIJc"><b>December 30th, 2020 MOSD Zoom call</b></a>
                (see <a href="https://sigsegv1980.github.io/j6/ProudBoys-2020-12-30-MOSDZoomMeetingTranscript.pdf"> transcript</a>), 
                <b>Enrique Tarrio</b> clearly explained the plan for January 6: <b>Tarrio</b> wanted to use the January 6 rally
                to conduct a <a href="https://youtu.be/9HY3IVStIJc?t=1460"><b>training exercise</b></a> to <i>field test</i> the <b>MOSD</b> 
                chapter — to take it for a spin out in the streets of DC and test the new
                command structure. 
                This is consistent with <b>Charles Donohoe</b>'s
                description of the plan for Jan 6 as 
                <i>“<a href="https://sigsegv1980.github.io/j6/ProudBoys-ExportedTelegramChatMOSDOp/messages.html#go_to_message441"><b>a simple and quick mission</b></a>”</i>.
                The objective was to
                <a href="https://youtu.be/9HY3IVStIJc?t=1019">divide the <b>MOSD</b> Proud Boys into smaller ten-man teams</a> while 
                maintaining formation and marching <i>“<a href="https://youtu.be/9HY3IVStIJc?t=1460"><b>as one fucking unit</b></a>”</i>. 
                (See also the <a href="#anc13">above section for a more thorough analysis of the Proud Boys' <b>actual</b> plan for January 6</a>.)
                <br><br>
                But by the morning 
                of January 5th, <b>Tarrio's</b> original plan to split up into smaller teams and field test the <b>MOSD</b> chapter
                had apparently fallen apart. There was 
                significant confusion 
                among senior <b>MOSD</b> leadership over the issue of <a href="https://sigsegv1980.github.io/j6/ProudBoys-NewMOSD-2021-1-4_2021-1-13.pdf#page=10">
                <b>breaking up into teams</b></a> (Govt Exhibit <b>509-15</b>).
                <b>Joe Biggs</b> seemed to have no clue what was going on in
                terms of breaking up into teams, while <b>Johnny Blackbeard</b> lamented that <i>“our plan 
                has totally broken down”</i>. Yet <b>Jeremy Bertino</b> dismissed the idea of teams entirely and
                confusingly asserted that everything should continue <i>“as planned”</i>, but did not elaborate any further on exactly

                Clearly, the revised plan for Jan 6 was not entirely
                clear even to senior leaders like <b>Joe Biggs</b> on the day before the big event. It's also 
                worth noting that after dismissing the idea of smaller teams, <b>Jeremy Bertino</b> 
                said that everything should <i>“move forward as planned <b>for the rally</b> tomorrow”</i>.
                It's a subtle point, but <b>Jeremy Bertino</b> explicitly refers to the Jan 6 plans as
                plans <i>“<b>for the rally</b> tomorrow”</i>, which really isn't the sort of phrasing I would
                expect intuitively if <b>Jeremy Bertino</b> was actually referring to some secret plan to storm the Capitol here.
                Rather, the phrasing suggests that <b>Jeremy Bertino</b> thinks of the Jan 6 plan as a plan <i><b>for
                a rally</b></i>, rather than a plan for some kind of illegal, covert operation to overtake the US Capitol
                building.
                <br><br>
                Regardless, the confusion over plans continued through January 5th and into January 6th itself. On the night of
                January 4th, senior <b>MOSD</b> leader <b>Ethan Nordean</b> (Rufio) was apparently
                <a href="https://sigsegv1980.github.io/j6/ProudBoys-MOSD-MAIN2-2021-1-4_2021-1-5.pdf#page=8">put in charge of
                the Jan 6 operation</a> (Govt Exhibit <b>510-9</b>). But then on the evening of January 5,
                the <b>MOSD</b> leaders had <a href="https://sigsegv1980.github.io/j6/ProudBoys-MOSD-MAIN2-2021-1-4_2021-1-5.pdf#page=15">trouble 
                even getting in touch with <b>Ethan Nordean</b></a> (Govt Exhibit <b>510-23</b>) due to mobile service outages
                in DC. At one point, comments were made suggesting <b>Enrique Tarrio</b> would soon retake control
                of the operation:

                At around 9:22 PM on the evening of Jan 5, <b>Joe Biggs</b> posted a message in the

                informing the other <b>MOSD</b> leaders that <i>“we have a plan. I'm with rufio”</i> (Govt Exhibit <b>509-23</b>). 
                It seems <b>Joe Biggs</b> or <b>Ethan Nordean</b> (Rufio) came up with
                some revised plan or sketch of a revised plan, but no specific details were provided over Telegram except the location of
                the initial morning meetup.
                It's possible the initial meeting place was
                the extent of <b>Biggs'</b> “plan” at the time. Whatever the case may be, it seems that <b>Joe Biggs</b> came up
                with this plan with little or no input from <b>Enrique Tarrio</b>, because after
                Biggs mentioned the plan and initial meetup location, <b>Jeremy Bertino</b> warned <i>“If Enrique has a better idea he needs to say
                it soon.”</i>
                <br><br>
                At this point, on the evening of January 5, <b>Enrique Tarrio</b> was hanging out in a hotel in Baltimore after
                he was <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20220712213106/https://twitter.com/maustermuhle/status/1346521554855874565">arrested in D.C. on January 4th</a> 
                and ordered by a judge to leave DC immediately. <b>Tarrio</b> <a href="https://sigsegv1980.github.io/j6/ProudBoys-NewMOSD-2021-1-4_2021-1-13.pdf#page=17">joined the <b>New MOSD</b> 
                Telegram group at <b>9:20 PM</b> on January 5th</a> at the invitation of <b>Jeremy Bertino</b>, but <b>Tarrio</b> didn't 
                participate in any discussions included in the Telegram exhibits. Regardless, on the
                evening of January 5th, a mere <i>twelve hours</i> before the big event, <b>Enrique Tarrio</b> and <b>Ethan Nordean</b>
                were mostly “missing in action”
                and senior <b>MOSD</b> leaders were <i>still</i> asking basic questions about the “plan”, which at this point
                seemed to consist solely of an initial meetup location:

                Less than <i>an hour</i> before the Capitol riot began, some of the rank-and-file Proud Boys began 
                <a href="https://sigsegv1980.github.io/j6/ProudBoys-MOSD-MAIN2-2021-1-4_2021-1-5.pdf#page=20">complaining
                about a <b>general lack of planning and leadership</b></a> (Govt Exhibit <b>510-32</b>). Lacking direction from their leaders, some
                groups of Proud Boys went off on their own to march around DC autonomously. In an attempt
                to improve morale and offer some leadership, <b>Johnny Blackbeard</b> posted relatively
                long voice messages in <a href="https://sigsegv1980.github.io/j6/ProudBoys-NewMOSD-2021-1-4_2021-1-13.pdf#page=26">
                <b>New MOSD</b></a> (Govt Exhibit <b>509-30</b>)
                and <a href="https://sigsegv1980.github.io/j6/ProudBoys-MOSD-MAIN2-2021-1-4_2021-1-5.pdf#page=19"><b>MOSD MAIN 2</b></a> (Govt Exhibit <b>510-31</b>), 
                telling the other Proud Boys 
                <i>“…don’t anybody lose hope”</i>. <b>Johnny Blackbeard</b> lamented the numerous difficulties
                that adversely impacted the planning for Jan 6, such as <b>Enrique Tarrio</b>'s arrest, and promised
                to conduct an <i>“after action report session”</i> to talk about what went wrong and <i>“make adjustments
                for the next time.”</i> <b>Johnny Blackbeard</b> reassured the Proud Boys that <i>“this is gonna be an iterative
                thing”</i> that would improve over time, and finished his voice message by telling everyone to <i>“do
                your best, have a good time.”</i>
                <br><br>
                <b>Johnny Blackbeard's</b> speech here sounds more like a high-school football coach trying to encourage an under-performing team
                than it sounds like someone preparing to help orchestrate a full-frontal assault on the US Capitol followed by an intense, 
                potentially life-altering siege and occupation. At the very least, <b>Johnny Blackbeard's</b> messages do not 
                reflect the mindset of someone expecting an historic, large-scale riot to erupt in the next 40 minutes.
                Indeed, <b>Johnny Blackbeard's</b> assurance that things would improve over time (<i>“this is gonna be an iterative thing”</i>)
                is consistent with <b>Zach Rehl's</b> statements during the <a href="https://youtu.be/9HY3IVStIJc?t=5708"><B>December 30 MOSD Zoom meeting</b></a>

                In conclusion, the indictment selectively quotes Telegram messages to suggest the Proud Boys had a secret, detailed plan to storm the Capitol, devised in advance of Jan 6.
                But there is simply no evidence that any such plan existed. The Telegram evidence shows that the <b>MOSD</b> leadership came up with <i>some</i> kind of revised plan 
                or itinerary for January 6 (likely similar to the <a href="https://sigsegv1980.github.io/j6/ProudBoys-EastCoastRallyCommandChat.pdf#page=2">
                <b>itinerary for the previous D.C. rally on December 12, 2020</b></a>), but it was seemingly devised at the 
                last minute under confusing circumstances, and it was communicated very poorly to the other <b>MOSD</b> Proud Boys.
                <br><br>
                Fortunately, it's fairly easy to deduce the Proud Boys' revised plans for January 6th, since we know exactly
                what the <b>MOSD</b> Proud Boys were up to during the morning of January 6th. 
                Documentary filmmaker <b>Eddie Block</b> followed the Proud Boys around the streets of DC throughout the morning of January 6th, 
                filming their march in an <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oSOsG5kN5wc"><b>uninterrupted livestream</b></a> right up until 
                the Capitol riot broke out in the early afternoon. Eddie Block's video shows us that the Proud Boys
                mostly just marched around the streets of DC <a href="https://youtu.be/oSOsG5kN5wc?t=5590">looking for Antifa</a>
                and chanting <i>“<a href="https://youtu.be/oSOsG5kN5wc?t=5620"><b>Fuck Antifa!</b></a>”</i>. The Proud Boys took 
                <a href="https://youtu.be/oSOsG5kN5wc?t=2051">group photos</a> and
                <a href="https://youtu.be/oSOsG5kN5wc?t=2726">mingled with ordinary Trump supporters</a> attending the rally, then hung around by 
                the <a href="https://youtu.be/oSOsG5kN5wc?t=3201">food trucks lining Constitution Ave</a>. 
                Eventually, when large crowds of Trump supporters started gathering
                by the Capitol, the Proud Boys <a href="https://youtu.be/oSOsG5kN5wc?t=5653">followed the crowds</a>.
                <br><br>
                The obvious confusion among <b>MOSD</b> leadership concerning the plan for Jan 6, along
                with <b>Eddie Block's</b> livestream video, strongly suggests that no secret conspiracy to storm the Capitol ever existed. 
                With no secret conspiracy, the Proud Boys would have expected the Jan 6 rally to play out similarly to 
                <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20201118012633/https://www.washingtonpost.com/dc-md-va/2020/11/14/million-maga-march-dc-protests/">earlier rallies</a>, 
                where the primary activity was a <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20201119003724/https://video.parler.com/Vw/KV/VwKViYWJTxob_small.mp4">public march</a> 
                and the primary threat was 
                <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20201213043848/https://www.the-sun.com/news/1959359/million-maga-march-dc-trump-steal-election-stabbing/"><b>Antifa</b> 
                counter-protesters</a>.
                This is consistent with the behavior of the Proud Boys as seen throughout 
                <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oSOsG5kN5wc"><b>the livestream</b></a> on the morning
                of January 6th, before the Capitol riot began.

                Included in the indictment to highlight how the Proud Boys used communication equipment (<a href="https://www.baofengradio.com/"><b>Baofeng</b> hand-held radios</a>)
                to coordinate with each other on Jan 6. Once again, the prosecution relies on natural <b>confirmation bias</b> to 
                lead the reader to interpret <i>any</i> hints of planning or coordination among the Proud Boys, including the use of 
                hand-held radios, as evidence <i>specifically</i> of a <b>seditious conspiracy</b> to storm the Capitol.
                Of course, the Proud Boys <a href="https://youtu.be/ZQawR_tbIC8?t=16845">often used radios</a> and other communication equipment at rallies, and the use
                of such equipment alone is certainly insufficient to demonstrate the existence of a secret plan to storm the Capitol.
                The Proud Boys used two-way radios on January 6 specifically because they 
                <a href="https://sigsegv1980.github.io/j6/ProudBoys-MOSD-MAIN-FullChatMessages-2020-12-27_2021-1-1.pdf#page=86">anticipated unreliable reception in DC</a> 
                during the rally.
                <br><br>
                Of much greater significance here is the inclusion of <b>Aaron Wolkind</b>'s instructive warning that <i>"<b>cops are 
                the primary threat</b>, don't get caught by them or BLM"</i>. This was included in the indictment because the
                prosecution claimed that the Proud Boys became antagonistic towards the police because the Proud Boys
                were planning to attack the Capitol, which necessarily would entail attacking the police who defend the Capitol.
                Indeed, the prosecution argued that any evidence of anti-police sentiment from the Proud Boys is also evidence that 
                the Proud Boys planned in advance to attack police on Jan 6 as part of the plan to storm the Capitol.

                However, this ignores a great deal of historical context that explains the Proud Boys' antagonism towards the cops,
                apart from any secret plans to attack the Capitol. (See the above discussion analyzing the <a href="#anc20">Proud Boys' evolving attitude towards the cops</a>.)
                Historically, the Proud Boys were generally <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20200605014442/https://twitter.com/philadelphiapb/status/1268719711602315264">
                supportive of the police</a>, especially before December of 2020. On December 12, 2020, during the second <b>"Million MAGA
                March"</b> rally in DC, four Proud Boys (including <b>Jeremy Bertino</b>)

                to be affiliated with a local <b>Antifa</b> group</a>.
                During the same rally, <b>Enrique Tarrio</b> decided to steal a <i>Black Lives Matter</i> banner 
                hanging outside Asbury United Methodist Church, and <a href="https://sigsegv1980.github.io/j6/ProudBoys-EnriqueTarrioArrestAffidavit-BLMBannerBurning.pdf">
                burn it publicly on the street</a> (or at least, take credit for burning it). The incident was framed as

                Finally, as the Proud Boys navigated the streets of DC during the night of December 12, 2020, they were

                The prosecution argued that the Proud Boys turned 
                against the police because the Proud Boys planned to attack the Capitol and therefore necessarily had to attack the police who defend it.
                But the historical context involving the December 12th rally <i>independently</i> explains why the Proud Boys turned against the police.
                We know <i>exactly</i> why the Proud Boys turned against the cops, and it had nothing to do with January 6. The Proud Boys'
                antagonism towards the police was <i>directly connected</i> to the Proud Boys' antagonism towards <b>Antifa</b> (hence the derisive
                portmanteau “coptifa”) because the Proud Boys believed 
                the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20210110174004/https://video.parler.com/Mn/C2/MnC26VemEctP_small.mp4">DC cops sided with <b>Antifa</b> on December 12, 2020</a>.
                <br><br>
                Finally, even <i>without</i> any knowledge of this historical context, <b>Aaron Wolkind's</b> message, quoted
                in the indictment, doesn't actually support the prosecution's case. <b>Wolkind</b> said: <i>“cops are the primary threat, don't get caught by 
                them or BLM, don't get drunk until off the street.”</i> If we assume, as the prosecution does,
                that <b>Aaron Wolkind</b> had in mind a secret plan to storm the Capitol when he told the Proud Boys that <i>“cops
                are the primary threat”</i>, we have to wonder what exactly <b>Wolkind</b> even meant when he added 
                <i>“don't get drunk until off the street”</i>.
                If <b>Wolkind's</b> warning about cops as <i>“the primary threat”</i> is to be interpreted
                as applying to a secret plan to attack the Capitol (wherein the Capitol Police would be the primary threat),
                then <i>“don't get drunk until off the street”</i> must also apply to attacking the Capitol. But what would that
                even <i>mean</i> in such a context? Was <b>Aaron Wolkind</b>
                telling the Proud Boys to wait until they're <i>inside</i> the Capitol building to get drunk?
                <br><br>
                Clearly, <b>Aaron Wolkind's</b> message here makes little sense within the context of some secret plan to attack
                the US Capitol building. But the warning to avoid getting drunk <i>“until off the street”</i> makes perfect sense if we 
                assume that <b>Aaron Wolkind's</b> entire message (including his warning about the cops) had absolutely <i>nothing</i> to do
                with any secret plan to storm the Capitol. Rather, <b>Aaron Wolkind's</b> orders likely applied to the <i>night</i>
                of January 5th (not the Jan 6 rally) when some Proud Boys likely conducted a nighttime exercise or march through
                the streets of DC. (The relevant Telegram posts here are dated to <b>January 5th</b> at around <B>9:10 PM</b>). Moreover, the 
                no drinking <i>“until off the street”</i> rule is consistent with <b>Charles Donohoe's</b>
                statements during the <b>MOSD Zoom meeting</b> on December 30, 2020, 
                <a href="https://youtu.be/9HY3IVStIJc?t=284">warning the <b>MOSD</b> Proud Boys not to get drunk</a> during marches or rallies,

                Included in the indictment because it establishes that the Proud Boys were meeting amongst themselves,

                planned together, ironing out all the <b>seditious</b> details of their secret plan to attack the US Capitol
                building. This is another example of the prosecution's fallacious assumption that
                <i>any</i> evidence of planning in general among the Proud Boys is also <i>specifically</i> evidence 
                of a pre-planned <b>seditious conspiracy</b> to storm the US Capitol.
                <br><br>
                The indictment quotes selectively from the Telegram exhibits to suggest

                Included in the indictment because it establishes that the Proud Boys had some sort of plan on January 6th, and that 
                this was at least partially devised by <b>Joe Biggs</b>, <b>Ethan Nordean</b> (Rufio), and <b>Enrique Tarrio</b>, and passed along to the other
                <b>MOSD</b> leaders. Once again, the prosecution assumes fallaciously that
                <i>any</i> evidence of planning in general among the Proud Boys is also <i>specifically</i> evidence 
                of a pre-planned <b>seditious conspiracy</b> to storm the US Capitol.
                <br><br>
                The indictment quotes selectively from the Telegram exhibits to suggest
                the Proud Boys had some clear, detailed plan to attack the Capitol building, conceived in advance of Jan 6,
                even though the Telegram evidence clearly demonstrates that on the <i>evening before</i> January 6th the 
                <b>MOSD</b> leadership was <i>still</i> scrambling to come up with a plan at the last minute.
                Indeed, the Telegram evidence demonstrates conclusively that the Proud Boys' <i>original</i> plan for January 6th
                — which, as <b>Enrique Tarrio</b> clearly explained during the 
                <a href="https://youtu.be/9HY3IVStIJc?t=1028"><b>MOSD Zoom meeting</b></a>,

                the Proud Boys saying some insane shit, beginning with <b>Aaron Wolkind</b>'s desire to see
                <i>“thousands of normies burn [Washington DC] to ash today”</i>. <b>Jeremy Bertino</b>
                chimes in, agreeing that such a thing <i>“would be epic”</i>.
                <br><br>
                Then <b>John Charles Stewart</b> (<b>Johnny Blackbeard</b>) takes the conversation in a new direction
                by expressing his animosity towards the police, saying he would settle for watching the normies
                (meaning ordinary Trump supporters) <i>“smash some pigs to dust”</i> (i.e. attack the cops)
                on January 6. <b>Johnny Blackbeard</b> then assures the other Proud Boys that the normies are likely
                to attack the police, because normies have no <i>“adrenaline control”</i>. Finally, <b>Johnny Blackbeard</b>
                expresses resentment over <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20210106002928/https://www.washingtonpost.com/local/public-safety/proud-boys-enrique-tarrio-arrest/2021/01/04/8642a76a-4edf-11eb-b96e-0e54447b23a1_story.html">
                <b>Enrique Tarrio</b>'s arrest</a> back on January 4 (for

                burning a <i>Black Lives Matter</i> 
                banner</a> owned by a church during the previous MAGA rally back in December),
                believing that the DC police <i>“went too far when 
                [they] arrested [Enrique] as a scare tactic”</i>.
                <br><br>
                This exhibit exemplifies the Proud Boys' <b>violent rhetoric</b>, and probably didn't help their chances at trial either.
                The prosecution framed these Telegram posts as evidence of the Proud Boys'
                secret plot to <i>“rile up a mob of normies”</i>, overwhelm the police, and storm the Capitol. After 
                all, <b>Johnny Blackbeard</b>'s comments somewhat telegraph all that, as he fantasizes about
                <i>“thousands of normies”</i> smashing the <i>“pigs to dust”</i>, then more or less <i>prophesies</i>
                that exactly such a thing is likely to happen on January 6th because the <i>“normiecons”</i> (normal conservatives) have 
                no <i>“adrenaline control”</i>.
                <br><br>
                However, the Proud Boys' fondness for violent rhetoric is not evidence of a <b>seditious conspiracy</b>.
                So we're left with their animosity towards the cops and their violent fantasies about a horde of "normies"
                attacking the cops. The prosecution framed evidence of the Proud Boys' animosity towards police
                as evidence of a pre-planned <b>seditious conspiracy</b> to attack police and storm the US Capitol. However, the Proud Boys
                were <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20200605014442/https://twitter.com/philadelphiapb/status/1268719711602315264">

                What about <b>Johnny Blackbeard</b>'s “prophecy” about normies with no adrenaline control attacking the police?
                Well, it turns out <b>Johnny Blackbeard</b> was <i>not</i> actually telegraphing the events of January 6. Rather,
                his imagination turned to the idea of “normies attacking police” because <b>Johnny Blackbeard</b> had recently
                <i>personally witnessed</i> a crowd of regular Trump supporters nearly attack the police during the <i>earlier</i> DC rally 
                on December 12, 2020. During a

                (see Govt Exhibit <b>501-40</b>) back on December 30, 2020, the Proud Boys were discussing the possibility that <b>Enrique Tarrio</b> 
                would be arrested at the hands of the DC Metro police (for 
                <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20201214214021/https://mpdc.dc.gov/release/suspects-sought-destruction-property-offense-900-block-11th-street-northwest">burning a

                flipping out and attacking police if <b>Enrique Tarrio</b> were to be arrested in public near a crowd of "normie" Trump supporters:

                Clearly, the idea of “normies attacking cops” came up among the Proud Boys because the Proud Boys actually
                <i><b>witnessed it almost happen</b></i> on December 12, 2020. Thus, merely discussing the idea of “normies
                attacking police” is not evidence in itself that the Proud Boys were actually <i><b>counting on</b></i> normies
                attacking the police as an integral component of a secret <b>seditious conspiracy</b> to storm the Capitol on Jan 6.
                It's worth noting that in the 12/30/2020 discussion quoted above, <b>Johnny Blackbeard</b> brought up the possibility
                of “normies attacking police” as a <i>concern</i> — not something he necessarily hoped would happen or
                outright planned to <i>make happen</i>. It's also worth noting that when <b>Johnny Blackbeard</b> brought
                up a similar concern about the possibility of rank-and-file Proud Boys attacking cops, <B>Enrique Tarrio</b>
                dismissed the idea as unlikely, saying 
                <i>“<a href="https://sigsegv1980.github.io/j6/ProudBoys-MOSDChat-2020-12-20_2021-1-4.pdf#page=26">They’re not gonna punch cops</a>”</i> (see Govt Exhibit <b>501-40</b>).</i>
                Again, this discussion happened only a week before Jan 6. Yet the prosecution claimed the Proud Boys leadership
                was expressly <i>relying on</i> rank-and-file Proud Boys (as well as normies) to <i>“punch cops”</i> as a key component of their secret
                <b>seditious conspiracy</b> to storm the Capitol.
                <br><br>
                Of course, on the day of Jan 6, the <a href="https://sigsegv1980.github.io/j6/ProudBoys-NewMOSD-2021-1-4_2021-1-13.pdf#page=23">
                discussion in the <b>New MOSD</b> chat group</a> (Govt Exhibit <b>509-26</b>), <a href="#anc36">quoted above</a> in the left column, clearly shows <b>Johnny Blackbeard</b> 
                venting his anger at the cops and fantasizing
                about normies attacking police. But as an evidentiary exhibit designed to showcase the Proud Boys'
                <b>violent rhetoric</b>, the conversation between <b>Charles Donohoe</b> and the other Proud 
                Boys quoted in the <a href="https://sigsegv1980.github.io/j6/ProudBoys-USAvCharlesDonohoe-PowerPointShowingExhibits.pdf">Detention Hearing Exhibit</a>
                (quoted above in the left column) is probably one of the <i>worst</i> possible examples the prosecution
                could have used to make their point. The exhibit itself hides the names of everyone involved except
                for <b>Charles Donohoe</b>, but the 
                <a href="https://sigsegv1980.github.io/j6/ProudBoys-NewMOSD-2021-1-4_2021-1-13.pdf#page=23">actual Telegram chat exhibit</a> reveals the Proud Boys who said these
                things: <b>Aaron Wolkind</b>, <b>Jeremy Bertino (Noble Beard)</b>, and <b>John Charles Stewart (Johnny Blackbeard)</b>.
                <br><br>
                As it turns out, <i>none</i> of these guys were even in Washington DC on January 6th, 2021. The <i>only</i> person 
                in the quoted discussion who
                was actually <i>on the ground</i> in DC on Jan 6 and actually <i>participated</i> in the Capitol riot was <b>Charles Donohoe</b> (YutYut Cowabunga),
                and he never said anything about “normies attacking police”. In fact, <b>Charles Donohoe</b> didn't even participate in
                the discussion about “normies” at all. Of course, in a <b>seditious conspiracy</b> trial like this, it isn't necessary to prove
                that the conspirators physically attacked the Capitol themselves, only that they helped to <i>plan</i>
                such an attack. But no evidence of any such plan exists, unless you count exhibits like this where the
                Proud Boys privately vent their anger towards the cops or the election. Moreover, the fact that none of the people venting their 
                violent fantasies about “normies attacking
                cops” were <i>even present</i> in DC on Jan 6 certainly at least significantly <i>weakens</i> the impact of this exhibit.
                <br><br>
                Moreover,
                the exhibit itself is not evidence of a plan to storm the Capitol. It actually has nothing to do with the Capitol
                or at all. It's merely evidence of the fact that
                some Proud Boys were angry at the police. And <a href="#anc20">
                as demonstrated above</a>, the Proud Boys' anger towards the cops had nothing to do
                with any secret plan to storm the Capitol and everything to do with their experience at the previous
                DC rally in December, along with the fact that the DC police

                This was not included in the indictment despite being obviously beneficial for the prosecution. This
                Telegram post, and <a href="https://sigsegv1980.github.io/j6/ProudBoys-BootsOnTheGroundChat.pdf#page=10">other similar posts</a>, 
                were most likely not included in the indictment because the
                Proud Boys who posted them were not present in DC on Jan 6 (they were monitoring the situation from home on Telegram) and were not
                charged as one of the main conspirators in the indictment. I've included this Telegram post here in this
                document simply to remind the reader that the Proud Boys trial
                was not about <i>physically</i> storming the Capitol, rather it was about <i>planning</i> and conspiring <i>in advance</i> of January 6 
                to storm the Capitol. There is no
                doubt that some Proud Boys participated in the Jan 6 Capitol riot and that many Proud Boy leaders,
                including <b>Jeremy Bertino</b> and <b>Enrique Tarrio</b>, <i>celebrated</i> the events of Jan 6 <i>after</i>
                the mob of Trump supporters breached through barricades and stormed the Capitol building.
                <br><br>
                Indeed, <b>Enrique Tarrio</b> didn't even hide the fact that he approved of the pro-Trump mob storming the Capitol.

                to encourage the rioters and to <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20210110185250/https://parler.com/post/45473a067c604cb49da69007c4245aba">
                tell them not to leave the Capitol building</a>. Moreover, upper-tier <b>MOSD</b> leaders like <b>Jeremy Bertino</b>
                posted <i>blatantly incriminating</i> things — like <i>“<b>Storming the capital right now!!</b>”</i> — in the private Telegram group chats.
                Clearly, the <b>MOSD</b> Proud Boys weren't too careful about what they posted on Telegram, despite occasionally paying

                Shortly after the <a href="https://sigsegv1980.github.io/j6/ProudBoysAtPeaceCircle.mp4">
                first barricade at the Peace Circle was breached</a>, <b>Joseph Biggs</b>
                and <b>Ethan Nordean</b> were near the Peace Circle and among the first wave of rioters who breached
                the barricade. This supports the prosecution's conspiracy case. But other <b>MOSD</b> Proud Boys,
                such as <b>Matthew “The People's Chairman” Walter</b>, had to be told to head towards the Capitol
                <i>after</i> the mob began storming it. And another <b>MOSD</b> Proud Boy using the Telegram handle
                “<b>Captain</b>” was all the way over by the White 
                House, <a href="https://www.google.com/maps/dir/The+White+House,+1600+Pennsylvania+Avenue+NW,+Washington,+DC+20500/U.S.+Capitol+Building,+Washington,+DC/@38.8905033,-77.0153833,16z/data=!4m14!4m13!1m5!1m1!1s0x89b7b7bcdecbb1df:0x715969d86d0b76bf!2m2!1d-77.0365298!2d38.8976763!1m5!1m1!1s0x89b7b82921a2cf17:0x482a3f7c10cf8c4!2m2!1d-77.0090505!2d38.8899389!3e2?entry=ttu&g_ep=EgoyMDI0MTExMi4wIKXMDSoASAFQAw%3D%3D">
                <b>over two miles</b></a> from the Capitol building, when the riot started.
                <br><br>
                Recall that the prosecution argued that the <b>MOSD</b> Proud Boys began planning to storm the
                Capitol <a href="https://sigsegv1980.github.io/j6/2023-08-17-USAvEthanNordeanAndJosephBiggsAndZacharyRehlAndEnriqueTarrioAndDominicPezzola-GovernmentSentencingMemorandum.pdf#page=38">as
                early as December 19th, 2020</a>.
                If the Proud Boys had a plan to storm the Capitol, devised well in advance of January 6, why weren't they
                all positioned close to the Capitol building when the riot started?
                <br><br>
                Of course, some high-ranking Proud Boys, like <b>Joseph Biggs</b> and <b>Ethan Nordean</b>, <i>were</i>
                near the Capitol building (by the Peace Circle) when
                the first barricade was breached. While this fact certainly helped the prosecution, the location of <b>Biggs</b>
                and <b>Nordean</b> by the Capitol building is easy to explain, whether or not any secret conspiracy to
                attack the Capitol building ever existed. Firstly, many of the 
                <a href="https://sigsegv1980.github.io/j6/USCapitolPolicePermitsForEventsNearCapitol.pdf"><b>official events</b></a> for the Jan 6 rally
                were located near the Capitol building, and earlier in the day the Proud Boys had
                <a href="https://youtu.be/oSOsG5kN5wc?t=1325">marched across the Capitol grounds to mingle
                with ordinary Trump supporters</a> attending these events. Secondly, many ordinary Trump supporters began walking towards the Capitol building during
                President Trump's speech at the Ellipse, and the 
                <a href="https://youtu.be/oSOsG5kN5wc?t=5382">Proud Boys simply marched along with this crowd</a>,
                just like <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20201212181701/https://twitter.com/ShelbyTalcott/status/1337823451327946755">they have always done at major rallies</a>.
                <br><br>
                Thus, while the existence of a secret, pre-planned conspiracy to storm the Capitol can explain
                the locations of <b>Biggs</b> and <b>Nordean</b> when the riot began, such a conspiracy <i>can't account</i>
                for the fact that at the moment the Capitol riot began, groups of <b>MOSD</b> Proud Boys were dispersed
                across various locations relatively far (in terms of walking distance) from the Capitol building. But if we instead assume
                there never was any conspiracy, it's easy to explain why many Proud Boys were off marching elsewhere when the riot began. Moreover, 
                the hypothesis that no formal plan to storm the Capitol ever existed
                is already strongly supported by a large body of <b><i><a href="ProudBoys-ExculpatoryChats.html">exculpatory Telegram evidence</a></i></b>. 
                For example, on the morning of January 6, less than two 
                hours before the mob breached the outer barricades and stormed the Capitol, many senior
                Proud Boy leaders were <a href="https://sigsegv1980.github.io/j6/ProudBoys-NewMOSD-2021-1-4_2021-1-13.pdf#page=25">

                On the morning of January 6, less than <i>an hour</i> before the riot started, another Proud Boy (using the Telegram handle <b>“Do you want total war?”</b>)
                complained that the plan for Jan 6 was, if anything, the <i>same</i> plan the Proud Boys had used
                back on <b>December 12, 2020</b>, during the second
                “<b>Million MAGA March</b>” rally in DC. In other words, the plan was a <a href="https://sigsegv1980.github.io/j6/ProudBoys-EastCoastRallyCommandChat.pdf#page=2">
                <b>typical itinerary for a typical Proud Boy march around DC</b></a>, not
                some <b>seditious conspiracy</b> to storm the Capitol building. And when one Proud Boy leader said he was off <i>“eating and chilling”</i>
                with his own chapter, <b>Jeremy Bertino</b> — one of the senior <b>MOSD</b> leaders — didn't respond by saying
                something like “Get your ass over to the Capitol building ASAP like we planned!!”. Instead, <b>Jeremy Bertino</b>
                responded casually by asking: <i>“[So you're] not watching Trump?”</i>

                Thus, the Telegram evidence makes it <i>abundantly clear</i> that on the morning of January 6, 
                the Proud Boys had no concept of any formal plan to storm the Capitol. Rather, different groups of <b>MOSD</b>-affiliated Proud Boys
                were spread around DC marching autonomously with little centralized leadership. One group was
                still <a href="https://sigsegv1980.github.io/j6/ProudBoys-BootsOnTheGroundChat.pdf#page=11">over by the White House</a> 
                30 minutes <i>after</i> the mob began storming the Capitol building. Other Proud Boys
                were off marching elsewhere, and only approached the Capitol <i>after</i> the riot was already in progress. 
                <br><br>
                On the morning of January 6, before the riot began, a group of Proud Boys led by <b>Ethan Nordean</b> 
                and <b>Joe Biggs</b> marched around the streets of DC, chanting slogans and looking for <b>Antifa</b>. 
                This early morning march was comprehensively <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oSOsG5kN5wc">

                <b>Eddie Block</b> <a href="https://youtu.be/oSOsG5kN5wc?t=2033">followed the Proud Boys around</a> the streets of DC in 
                his motorized wheelchair, filming everything they did right up until the Capitol riot began. Occasionally, individual Proud Boys would stop to help
                <a href="https://youtu.be/oSOsG5kN5wc?t=1556">carry Eddie over obstacles or down concrete steps</a>.

                As a valuable source of <b><i>exculpatory</i></b> evidence, <b>Eddie Block's</b> livestream brings into focus a recurring theme with the prosecution's <b>seditious conspiracy</b>
                case: the prosecution often tried to frame <i>standard</i> or <i>routine</i> things the Proud Boys regularly did at rallies 
                as <i>suspicious</i> behavior indicative of a secret plot to storm the Capitol. This worked out pretty well for the prosecution,
                since the average person (and average jury member) has no idea what the Proud Boys actually do at a typical rally. The jury
                needed to first be taught what was <i>expected</i> to happen at a <i>typical</i> Proud Boy rally before being asked to 
                assess what happened on January 6.
                <br><br>
                Watching <a href="https://youtu.be/oSOsG5kN5wc?t=2880"><b>Eddie Block's</b> livestream</a>, we see the Proud Boys
                <a href="https://youtu.be/oSOsG5kN5wc?t=2399">marching around the streets of DC</a> chanting slogans, <a href="https://youtu.be/oSOsG5kN5wc?t=2051">taking group photos</a>,
                <a href="https://youtu.be/oSOsG5kN5wc?t=1325">mingling with ordinary Trump supporters</a>,
                and <a href="https://youtu.be/oSOsG5kN5wc?t=4257">hanging around chatting and eating lunch by the food trucks</a> on Constitution Avenue. While the Proud Boys
                understood January 6 to be a bit different from previous rallies (mostly because of the <a href="#anc15">new <b>MOSD</b> structure</a>), it's clear
                that much of what the Proud Boys are seen doing throughout <b>Eddie Block's</b> livestream matches what we know of the
                Proud Boys' <a href="https://sigsegv1980.github.io/j6/ProudBoys-EastCoastRallyCommandChat.pdf#page=2"><b>itinerary for a <i>previous</i> rally in DC</b></a>
                in December of 2020, 
                including <b>Enrique Tarrio's</b> mandate to <i>“[W]in hearts and minds. Shake hands
                kiss babies. Let the people know who the Proud Boys are”</i> and to <i>“recruit patriots to join as we enjoy a march through the streets of DC”</i>.
                This sort of concern with “public relations” and promoting the Proud Boy “brand” is clearly evident in <b>Eddie Block's</b>
                Jan 6 livestream, as the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oSOsG5kN5wc&t=2726s">Proud Boys waved and signaled to their fans</a> 
                on the sidelines. It's also consistent with the fact that 
                half of the <b>MOSD</b> chapter's <a href="https://sigsegv1980.github.io/j6/ProudBoys-MOSD-MAIN-FullChatMessages-2020-12-27_2021-1-1.pdf#page=194">upper-tier leadership was part of
                <b>“Marketing”</b></a>.
                <br><br>
                On the morning of January 6, the Proud Boys
                seemed focused mostly on finding local <b>Antifa</b>, their <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20171016061411/http://gothamist.com/2017/02/03/nyu_proud_boy_protest.php">
                long-time street rivals</a>.
                As the Proud Boys marched down <b>Constitution Ave NW,</b> they
                often <a href="https://youtu.be/oSOsG5kN5wc?t=538">chanted <b><i>“Fuck Antifa!”</i></b> and <b><i>“Whose streets? Our streets!”</i></b></a>,
                both typical chants often heard during Proud Boy marches. But the <a href="https://youtu.be/oSOsG5kN5wc?t=2905"><b>“Fuck Antifa”</b> chant</a> was the most common chant
                throughout the morning of Jan 6 (see, for example,
                timestamps <a href="https://youtu.be/oSOsG5kN5wc?t=497"><b>8:18</b></a>, 
                <a href="https://youtu.be/oSOsG5kN5wc?t=773"><b>12:53</b></a>, 
                <a href="https://youtu.be/oSOsG5kN5wc?t=799"><b>13:39</b></a>, 
                <a href="https://youtu.be/oSOsG5kN5wc?t=1297"><b>21:38</b></a>, 
                <a href="https://youtu.be/oSOsG5kN5wc?t=1736"><b>28:57</b></a>, 
                <a href="https://youtu.be/oSOsG5kN5wc?t=2033"><b>33:50</b></a>, 
                <a href="https://youtu.be/oSOsG5kN5wc?t=2660"><b>44:20</b></a>, 
                <a href="https://youtu.be/oSOsG5kN5wc?t=2905"><b>48:25</b></a>, 
                <a href="https://youtu.be/oSOsG5kN5wc?t=5620"><b>1:33:40</b></a>, 
                <a href="https://youtu.be/oSOsG5kN5wc?t=5700"><b>1:35:00</b></a>).
                <br><br>
                Indeed, towards
                the end of <b>Eddie Block's</b> livestream, mere <i>minutes</i> before the first barricade was breached and the Capitol riot began,
                the Proud Boys were 
                <i><b>still</b></i> marching down Constitution Ave <a href="https://youtu.be/oSOsG5kN5wc?t=5590">chanting <i><b>“Where's Antifa?”</b></i></a>.&nbsp;
                Additionally, <b>Eddie Block</b> often made comments about <b>Antifa</b> as he livestreamed,
                such as <a href="https://youtu.be/oSOsG5kN5wc?t=3125">
                <i>“If you're <b>Antifa</b> and you're out there come find us! We're looking for you!”</i></a> (timestamp <b>52:05</b>) and 
                <a href="https://youtu.be/oSOsG5kN5wc?t=2711"><i>“We're letting <b>Antifa</b> know we run this town!”</i></a> (timestamp <b>45:11</b>).
                <br><br>
                While it's clear the Proud Boys were focused more on <b>Antifa</b> (who never showed up) than any imagined 
                Capitol-related <b>seditious conspiracy</b>, the prosecution
                pointed out that both <b>Joseph Biggs</b> and <b>Ethan Nordean</b> were <a href="https://sigsegv1980.github.io/j6/ProudBoysAtPeaceCircle.mp4">very 
                close to the first barricade</a> when
                it was breached by the mob at around <b>12:52 PM</b>. Yet as we can see from the livestream, <b>Biggs</b> and <b>Nordean</b>
                simply <a href="https://youtu.be/oSOsG5kN5wc?t=5382">followed the large crowd of Trump supporters</a> 
                to the Capitol building after President Trump's 
                speech concluded,
                while <a href="https://youtu.be/oSOsG5kN5wc?t=5594"><i>still</i> chanting <b><i>“Where's Antifa?”</i></b></a>.
                Shortly before the first barricade was breached, <b>Joseph Biggs</b>
                and <b>Ethan Nordean</b> were taking a break from the march, eating and socializing by <a href="https://youtu.be/oSOsG5kN5wc?t=4257">
                a line of food trucks parked</a> on Constitution Avenue,
                north of the Capitol building.
                The Proud Boys <a href="https://youtu.be/oSOsG5kN5wc?t=5382">resumed their march</a> at 
                around the time the crowd started heading towards the Capitol building.
                Naturally, <b>Biggs</b>, <b>Nordean</b>, and their contingent of Proud Boys, decided to march alongside this crowd towards the Capitol
                (again while still <a href="https://youtu.be/oSOsG5kN5wc?t=5620">chanting <i><b>“Fuck Antifa!”</b></i></a>). All of this
                — the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20201212171441/https://twitter.com/ShelbyTalcott/status/1337804059085070336">marching alongside ordinary
                Trump supporters</a>, 
                the <i><b>“<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20201119003724/https://video.parler.com/Vw/KV/VwKViYWJTxob_small.mp4">Fuck Antifa!</a>”</b></i> chants — 
                was <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20201212181701/https://twitter.com/ShelbyTalcott/status/1337823451327946755"><i>typical</i> behavior for the Proud Boys</a> 
                at a public MAGA rally like Jan 6.
                <br><br> 
                But there's no evidence any Proud Boy knew the pro-Trump mob was about to tear down barricades and storm the Capitol, and there
                wouldn't necessarily have been any cause for alarm (at least not at first) when the crowd started walking towards the Capitol building. Indeed, the
                <b>National Park Service</b> (the agency that issued all the
                <a href="https://sigsegv1980.github.io/j6/KylieKremer-Jan6PermitForWomenForAmericaFirst-Amended.pdf"><b>permits</b> for the official protest events</a> 
                held on January 6th) 
                was actually <i>expecting</i> to see <a href="https://sigsegv1980.github.io/j6/CindyChafian-PermitEmailsWithNPSForJan6Event.pdf#page=61">
                <i>“large groups of unorganized individuals [traveling] between the Ellipse and the US Capitol throughout the day”</i></a> (page 61 of PDF). It
                was completely expected that after President Trump finished speaking, portions of the crowd would 
                <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20210104133442/https://marchtosaveamerica.com/">head to the US Capitol building</a> where
                they were expected to participate in <a href="https://sigsegv1980.github.io/j6/Jan6MAGARallyMapGuideFull.pdf"><b>official protest events</b></a>, 
                such as <b>Ali Alexander's</b> 
                <a href="https://sigsegv1980.github.io/j6/USCapitolPolicePermitsForEventsNearCapitol.pdf">“One Nation Under God” rally</a>
                at “Area 8” by the US Capitol, or the <a href="https://sigsegv1980.github.io/j6/LatinosForTrumpJan6Flyer.pdf"><b>“Latinos for Trump”</b> rally at “Area 7”</a>.
                Obviously, all of these official events were moot once the mob began storming the Capitol at around <b>12:52 PM</b>.
                <br><br>
                Thus, <b>Eddie Block's</b> livestream from the morning of January 6th demonstrates <i>fairly conclusively</i> that the Proud Boys
                never had any secret plan to storm the Capitol devised in advance of Jan 6. Rather, the <b>MOSD</b> group of Proud Boys 
                marched around the streets of DC like they typically do at rallies, and then after hanging around 
                <a href="https://youtu.be/oSOsG5kN5wc?t=4257">eating lunch
                and socializing by the food trucks</a> on Constitution Avenue, the Proud Boys simply
                <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oSOsG5kN5wc&t=5574s"><i>followed</i> the crowd of Trump supporters</a> 
                walking from the Ellipse to the Capitol building shortly before the
                outer barricade was breached.
                <br><br>
                Another video, filmed by independent journalist “<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20210422032841/https://wysiwygtv.com/">WYSYWYG Tv</a>”,
                captured what happened immediately <i>after</i> <b>Eddie Block's</b> livestream came to an end. When the 
                <a href="https://sigsegv1980.github.io/j6/ProudBoysArriveAtPeaceCircleBeforeInitialBreach.mp4"><b>MOSD</b> Proud Boys arrived
                at the Peace Circle</a> (east of the Capitol building), a fairly large crowd of ordinary Trump supporters was
                already present, waving flags and chanting patriotic slogans. Notably, the Proud Boys were <i>still</i> chanting
                <i><b>“Fuck Antifa!”</b></i> as they arrived, less than <i>5 minutes</i> before the Capitol riot began.
                <br><br>
                Furthermore, the <i><b>precise moment</b></i> when the first barricade was breached (at <b>12:52 PM</b> on January 6th, 2021)
                was <i>thoroughly</i> documented on video from multiple perspectives. These videos definitively prove that
                the Proud Boys were not among the frontline group of rioters that initiated the riot by toppling the outer barricade. 
                Instead, the Proud Boys 
                <a href="https://sigsegv1980.github.io/j6/ProudBoysAtPeaceCircle-StandingBehindCrowdChantingAboutAntifa.mp4">were standing much further back</a> 
                (<i>still</i> chanting about <b>Antifa</b>!) behind a dense crowd of ordinary
                Trump supporters standing between the Proud Boys and the police barricade.
                A group of ordinary Trump supporters — not Proud Boys — pushed against the barricade and
                knocked it over, opening the floodgates and initiating the Capitol riot. This frontline group of Trump supporters included
                a man named <b>Ryan Samsel</b>, who was later arrested and 
                <a href="https://sigsegv1980.github.io/j6/2021-01-29-USAvRyanSamsel-StatementOfFacts.pdf">charged with assaulting a Capitol police officer</a>. 
                In a <a href="https://sigsegv1980.github.io/j6/2025-01-19-USAvRyanSamsel-GovernmentSentencingMemorandum.pdf#page=2">Government Sentencing Memo</a>, 
                the prosecution said of <b>Ryan Samsel</b>:

                    <div class="inner-blurb">
                    Samsel was the <b>first rioter to breach the restricted perimeter</b> on January 6, 2021. He
                    unilaterally opened a section of fencing at the curb of the Peace Circle – the first barricade
                    separating crowds from the restricted U.S. Capitol grounds – and walked onto the restricted Capitol
                    grounds, paving the way for thousands of other rioters to follow him. Samsel then made his way
                    to a second barrier guarded by U.S. Capitol Police (USCP) officers. He verbally abused officers,
                    and then joined his co-defendant Stephen Randolph (Randolph) in forcibly pushing and pulling on
                    this second barrier – a linked metal, bike-rack barricade. Samsel then participated in the first
                    violent assault of officers defending the Capitol building that day. 
                    </div>
                </div>
                Multiple videos clearly show that <b>Ryan Samsel</b>, along with three or four other ordinary
                Trump supporters (none of whom were Proud Boys),
                knocked over the outer barricade and initiated the riot while the Proud Boys were standing
                much further back in the middle of the crowd.

                <b>Ryan Samsel</b> can be seen standing right behind the barricade, face to face with
                the cordon of Capitol police officers. <b>Samsel</b> wore a <b>red MAGA baseball cap</b>
                and a light blue jacket, but at timestamp <b>0:35</b> he removed the light blue jacket,
                revealing a black t-shirt worn over a long sleeve white shirt with a hood. 
                <a href="https://sigsegv1980.github.io/j6/SamselAtFirstBarricadeByPeaceCircle-Perspective2.mp4">Another video
                shows the same event</a> from a different angle. Once again, we see that <b>Samsel</b>
                and a few other frontline rioters aggressively pushed and pulled the metal barricade until
                it toppled over: 
                <br><br>
                <div class = "media_wrap clearfix">
                    <a class = "video_file_wrap clearfix pull_left" href="https://sigsegv1980.github.io/j6/SamselAtFirstBarricadeByPeaceCircle-Perspective2.mp4">

                        <div class = "video_play"></div>
                    </div>
                    <div class="video_duration">1:16</div>

                    </a>
                </div>
                <br>
                The moment the barricade toppled was also filmed from the opposite angle, providing
                a closer view of the <a href="https://sigsegv1980.github.io/j6/InitialBreachAtPeaceCircle-Closeup.mp4">group of frontline rioters</a>
                who toppled the barricade. 
                Clearly, none of the Proud Boys
                were involved in toppling the barricade. Additionally,
                a video recovered from <b>MOSD</b> leader <b>Zach Rehl</b>'s iPhone shows 
                <a href="https://sigsegv1980.github.io/j6/ZachRehlVideoAtPeaceCircle.mp4"><b>Zach Rehl's</b>
                perspective when the first barricade was toppled</a>. This video
                clearly demonstrates that <b>Zach Rehl</b> and the group of <b>MOSD</b> Proud Boys
                were standing much further back behind the crowd when the riot began.
                <br><br>
                Thus, multiple videos shot from different angles demonstrate conclusively that none of the <b>MOSD</b>
                Proud Boys directly initiated the riot. Rather, they remained further back behind the crowd,
                still chanting about <b>Antifa</b>, when the riot began. Indeed, the behavior of the Proud Boys
                was mostly <b><i>indistinguishable</i></b> from the behavior of hundreds of ordinary Trump
                supporters in the crowd. The prosecution claimed that the Proud Boys had planned to
                incite a riot by <i>“riling up the normies”</i>. Perhaps <b>Joe Biggs'</b> proactive attempt to
                <a href="https://sigsegv1980.github.io/j6/ProudBoysAtPeaceCircle-StandingBehindCrowdChantingAboutAntifa.mp4">get the crowd going with a chant</a> 
                can be interpreted as evidence supporting
                the prosecution's theory. At least, <b>Zach Rehl</b> seemed to believe that a
                <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20210110202144/https://parler.com/post/9de0c58e6a9d4b2e80543a0dfe71ee53">Proud Boy chant</a>
                inadvertently excited the “normies” and
                <a href="https://sigsegv1980.github.io/j6/ProudBoys-BootsOnTheGroundChat.pdf#page=14">catalyzed the riot</a>. But 
                <b>Rehl's</b> claim
                would be much more convincing if <b>Joe Biggs</b>
                wasn't <i><b>still</b></i> 
                <a href="https://sigsegv1980.github.io/j6/ProudBoysAtPeaceCircle-StandingBehindCrowdChantingAboutAntifa.mp4">chanting about <b>Antifa</b></a> 
                one minute before the riot began. Indeed, many of the ordinary Trump supporters were <i>already</i>
                chanting more appropriately 
                <a href="https://sigsegv1980.github.io/j6/ZachRehlVideoAtPeaceCircle.mp4">patriotic slogans like “<b>USA! USA!</b>”</a> even as <b>Joe Biggs</b> continued 
                to obsess over <b>Antifa</b>.

                        One minute before the Capitol riot began, <b>Joe Biggs</b> and <b>Zach Rehl</b> led the crowd in chanting <i>“<b>Fuck Antifa!</b>”</i>, which
                        hardly seems like an appropriate chant if your goal is to incite the crowd to attack the cops and storm the Capitol.
                    </div>
                </div>
                <br>                
                Thus, the video evidence conclusively demonstrates that the Proud Boys took no <i>clear</i>, proactive measures
                to catalyze the riot or storm the Capitol, apart from trying to start a chant. Of course, the Proud Boys
                <i>regularly</i> chant during rallies or marches, and there's no evidence this <i>particular</i> bout
                of chanting near the Peace Circle was specifically intended to incite a riot. <b>Joe Biggs</b>
                chanted about <b>Antifa</b> anyway, which hardly seems appropriate if <b>Biggs</b> truly was trying to
                incite the crowd to steamroll the police and storm the Capitol building.
                <br><br>
                Abundant video evidence makes it very clear that the Proud Boys played no clearly discernible role in catalyzing 
                the riot. Moreover, <b>Ryan Samsel</b> and the other frontline protesters who <i>actually</i> toppled the barricade 
                and initiated the riot were
                ordinary Trump supporters, <i>not</i> Proud Boys. However, the prosecution attempted to
                strengthen the connection between these frontline rioters and the <b>MOSD</b> Proud Boys by 
                highlighting one particularly odd moment that occurred at one or two minutes before
                the riot began. <b>Ryan Samsel</b> walked up to <b>Joe Biggs</b>, briefly placed his arm around
                him, and <a href="https://sigsegv1980.github.io/j6/RyanSamselAndJoeBiggs.mp4">said something to <b>Biggs</b> in private</a>:

                This brief interaction lasted no more than a few seconds. It's unknown what <b>Ryan Samsel</b> said to <b>Joe Biggs</b>, or 
                how <b>Samsel</b> even <i>knew</i> <b>Biggs</b>. 
                There's no evidence <b>Samsel</b> was ever a Proud Boy, and <b>Samsel</b> <i>certainly</i> never participated in any
                of the <b>MOSD</b> Telegram group chats. Nonetheless, the prosecution capitalized on this odd moment
                by suggesting that <b>Joe Biggs</b> may have <i>instructed</i> <b>Ryan Samsel</b> to topple the barricade.
                <b>Samsel</b> later told the FBI that <b>Joe Biggs</b> indeed ordered him to topple the barricade,
                and that <b>Biggs</b> even threatened him by flashing a gun after he hesitated. However, there's no
                evidence to corroborate <b>Samsel's</b> claim. The prosecution conceded that <b>Joe Biggs</b>
                was not carrying a gun on January 6th, and the 
                <a href="https://threadreaderapp.com/thread/1649001117055893504.html">Judge instructed the jury that</a>
                <i>“no party contends there was a gun possessed by <b>Biggs</b> or any other defendant on 1/6.”</i> 
                Moreover, <b>Ryan Samsel</b> had an 
                <a href="https://sigsegv1980.github.io/j6/2022-05-18-USAvRyanSamsel-Order-CriminalHistory.pdf">extensive criminal history</a>
                involving assault and “terroristic threats”, and according to the prosecution, <b>Samsel</b>
                <a href="https://sigsegv1980.github.io/j6/2025-01-19-USAvRyanSamsel-GovernmentSentencingMemorandum.pdf#page=30">lied extensively 
                to authorities and to the media</a> about what occurred on January 6th.
                <br><br>
                Thus, any conclusions drawn from <b>Ryan Samsel's</b> brief interaction with <b>Joe Biggs</b> are
                entirely speculative, and there's no evidence
                that <b>Joe Biggs</b> told <b>Ryan Samsel</b> to do anything. The situation is further complicated by the
                fact that another man in a red cap, later identified as <b>Ray Epps</b> (not a Proud Boy), 
                <a href="https://sigsegv1980.github.io/j6/RayEppsTalksToSamselRightBeforeFirstBreach.mp4">whispered something 
                to <b>Ryan Samsel</b></a> a few seconds before <b>Samsel</b> toppled the barricade. Again, any conclusions
                drawn from this are purely speculative, and the most likely scenario is that <b>Ryan Samsel</b>
                simply acted on his own volition when he helped topple the barricade. In any case, <b>Samsel's</b> brief interaction with <b>Joe Biggs</b>
                can be explained by the fact that <b>Samsel</b> simply wanted to <i>meet</i> <b>Biggs</b>, because <b>Biggs</b> 
                was a minor Internet celebrity within the MAGA movement whose “War Boys” podcast featured famous guests 
                like <b>Alex Jones</b>.
                <br><br>
                In conclusion, the actions of the <b>MOSD</b> Proud Boys on January 6th before the riot began were
                documented <b><i>extensively</i></b>. Video evidence such as <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oSOsG5kN5wc"><b>Eddie Block's</b> livestream</a>
                and footage of
                the <a href="https://sigsegv1980.github.io/j6/SamselAtFirstBarricadeByPeaceCircle.mp4">initial breach</a> 
                all suggest that the Proud Boys
                viewed January 6th as a typical rally and never had any secret plan to storm the Capitol. The
                Capitol riot was initiated by ordinary Trump supporters, not Proud Boys, and the video evidence strongly
                suggests the riot occurred spontaneously without any pre-planning or conspiring in advance.

                This was not included in the indictment, however I include it here because it's the only potentially
                incriminating moment in an otherwise mostly <b><i>exculpatory</i></b> livestream video.
                On the morning of January 6, before the Capitol riot began, a group of <b>MOSD</b> Proud Boys led by <b>Ethan Nordean</b> 
                and <b>Joe Biggs</b> marched around the streets of DC, chanting slogans and looking for <b>Antifa</b>. 
                This morning march was comprehensively <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oSOsG5kN5wc">
                <b>captured on video by documentary filmmaker Eddie Block</b></a> in an unedited one hour and 40 minute livestream.
                <b>Eddie Block</b> <a href="https://youtu.be/oSOsG5kN5wc?t=2033">followed the Proud Boys around</a> the streets of DC in 
                his motorized wheelchair, filming everything they did right up until the Capitol riot began. This livestream
                is a significant source of <b>exculpatory evidence</b>, because it demonstrates <i>fairly conclusively</i> that
                on the morning of January 6th, the Proud Boys behaved exactly like they always have at rallies — they marched
                through the city streets, chanted slogans and searched for <b>Antifa</b> counter-protesters. Nothing in
                the video specifically supports the prosecution's claim that the Proud Boys had a secret plan to storm the Capitol, devised
                well <i>in advance</i> of January 6th, 2021.
                <br><br>
                However, <b>Eddie Block's</b> Jan 6 livestream video is not <i>entirely</i> exculpatory — there is at least one 
                ostensibly incriminating moment. At
                <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oSOsG5kN5wc&t=1971s">around timestamp <b>32:52</b></a> the <b>MOSD</b> Proud Boys are seen
                standing around west of the Capitol building, and one of them can be 
                heard saying
                <i>“let's take the fucking Capitol!”</i>. This happened about an hour before the first barricade was breached and the Capitol riot
                began. During the intervening hour, the Proud Boys <a href="https://youtu.be/oSOsG5kN5wc?t=2361">left the Capitol grounds</a>, 
                <a href="https://youtu.be/oSOsG5kN5wc?t=2660">marched down Constitution Avenue</a>, took a <a href="https://youtu.be/oSOsG5kN5wc?t=3201">
                lunch break by the food trucks</a>, and then followed a crowd of ordinary Trump supporters <a href="https://youtu.be/oSOsG5kN5wc?t=5620">
                towards the east side of the Capitol building</a> shortly before the riot began, all while
                frequently <a href="https://youtu.be/oSOsG5kN5wc?t=5700">chanting <i><b>“Fuck Antifa!”</b></a></i>.&nbsp; The audio in the livestream is
                a bit difficult to make out, but the Proud Boy who said <i>“let's take the fucking Capitol!”</i> was <b>Daniel Lyons Scott</b>
                (a.k.a. <b>Milkshake</b>). Other Proud Boys immediately admonished <b>Daniel Lyons Scott</b>, with one saying <i>“Let’s not fucking yell that, all right?”</i>
                (timestamp <a href="https://youtu.be/oSOsG5kN5wc?t=1979"><b>32:59</b></a>).
                <b>Ethan Nordean</b> then muttered into his megaphone <i>“It was Milkshake, man... you know, idiot”</i> 
                (timestamp <a href="https://youtu.be/oSOsG5kN5wc?t=1984"><b>33:04</b></a>).
                <br><br>
                Obviously, the
                prosecution would argue that <b>“Milkshake”</b> spilled the beans in public about the secret plan to storm the Capitol, 
                and was thus harshly silenced by his co-conspirators. The defense
                would argue that <b>“Milkshake”</b> was merely joking around, and that the other Proud Boys warned him not to joke publicly about things like that.
                This sort of evidence has to be assessed holistically and weighed against other exculpatory or incriminating evidence. <b>Daniel
                Lyons Scott</b> was a rank-and-file Proud Boy, not a <b>MOSD</b> leader involved in the planning for Jan 6. Moreover, 
                <a href="#anc22">as argued in the section above</a>,
                the concept of “storming/taking/occupying the Capitol” was not some esoteric idea discussed only by the Proud Boys or applicable <i>only</i>
                to January 6th. 
                <br><br>
                The idea of “storming” or
                <i>occupying</i> Capitol buildings became part of the <i>ethos</i> of the online MAGA-sphere and the 2020 
                <b>“<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20201231183223/https://stopthesteal.us/">Stop the Steal</a>”</b>
                movement after Trump lost the election. Between November of 2020 and January 5th, 2021, there were 
                <a href="https://sigsegv1980.github.io/j6/ZenodoParlerPostsFromNovember2020ToJanuary2021WithKeywordStormTheCapitol_IncludingEchoes.html">
                <b>468 Parler posts that exhorted Trump supporters to “storm the Capitol”</b></a> (or some variation of that phrase), and around 
                <a href="https://sigsegv1980.github.io/j6/ParlerPostsUsingOccupyLikeProgressives_2020_IncludingEchoes.html">
                <b>3,450</b> Parler posts telling Trump supporters to <i>occupy</i> a Capitol building</a> or something similar.
                In some cases, “storming the Capitol” didn't even necessarily refer to a violent or illegal act. For example,
                a conservative media outlet <a href="https://www.thegatewaypundit.com/2020/11/happening-now-alex-jones-leading-crowd-trump-supporters-storming-georgia-state-capitol-video/">used 
                the phrase <i>“storming the Capitol”</i></a> to describe a <i><b>legal</b></i> protest held inside the Georgia State Capitol building in November of 2020. Even
                documentary filmmaker <b>Eddie Block</b>, who livestreamed the Proud Boys marching on Jan 6, was initially rather tongue-in-cheek when he
                first saw the MAGA crowd descend upon the US Capitol building, exclaiming <i><b>“Look at this folks! We're storming the Capitol!”</b></i> 
                (<a href="https://youtu.be/oSOsG5kN5wc?t=5923">timestamp <b>1:38:43</b></a>). But as <b>Eddie Block</b> drew
                closer to the melee, he soon realized that people 
                were <i>literally</i> breaking down barricades and storming the Capitol building. Eddie then spoke with a tone of genuine surprise, saying 
                <i><b>“Oh shit! We're tearing it down!”</b></i> (<a href="https://youtu.be/oSOsG5kN5wc?t=5943">timestamp <b>1:39:03</b></a>).
                <br><br>
                Thus, it should be obvious that merely identifying an isolated, non-sequitor usage of the phrase “storm/take the Capitol” is <i>not</i> sufficient

                this fact was never in dispute. Over a thousand people stormed the Capitol, and most were charged with misdemeanors
                related to trespassing or picketing on US Capitol grounds. Just because the Proud Boys participated in the riot
                does not mean they actually planned in advance of Jan 6 to <i>orchestrate</i> the riot, and Telegram
                evidence suggests no such plan ever existed. For example, Proud Boy <b>Zach Rehl</b>, an upper-tier <b>MOSD</b>

                actually <i>on the ground</i> in DC storming the Capitol building, when in fact neither <b>Aaron Wolkind</b> nor <b>Jeremy Bertino</b> 
                were even present in Washington DC
                on January 6th. Only <b>Charles Donohoe</b> actually participated in the Capitol riot. Also, highlighting a Telegram
                post where a Proud Boy (who wasn't even in DC on Jan 6) eagerly suggests throwing <i>“eggs and rotten tomatoes”</i> (presumably
                at the police), isn't exactly the most effective way to paint the Proud Boys as violent insurrectionists. They didn't even bring
                guns.

                <b>Dominic Pezzola</b> was <a href="#anc16"><b>one of the first rioters</b></a> to breach the Capitol building when he used a stolen riot shield to
                smash a window on the upper terrace. However, <b>Dominic Pezzola</b> (a.k.a “<b>Spazzo - 2nd°</b>” on Telegram) was a rank-and-file Proud Boy
                who had little or no input in actually planning for Jan 6. <b>Pezzola</b> became a 
                Proud Boy less than <i>two months</i> before Jan 6 (see <a href="https://sigsegv1980.github.io/j6/2023-04-05-USAvProudBoys-TranscriptOfJuryTrial-Day60.pdf#page=82">

                chat group</a> (see Government Exhibit <b>507-7</b>) as late as January 2, 2021, only <i>4 days</i> before Jan 6, and he rarely posted anything after joining.
                <br><br>
                However, <b>Charles Donohoe</b> (<b>YutYut Cowabunga</b> on Telegram) was a <b>MOSD</b>
                leader who helped organize the <b>MOSD</b> chapter (see the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9HY3IVStIJc">December 30, 2020 <b>MOSD Zoom call</b></a>
                and <a href="https://sigsegv1980.github.io/j6/ProudBoys-2020-12-30-MOSDZoomMeetingTranscript.pdf">full transcript</a>)
                and helped plan <a href="#anc28">the itinerary</a> for Jan 6. But since <b>Dominic Pezzola</b> was one of the first rioters to actually
                breach the Capitol building, the prosecution aggressively called attention to any evidence suggesting <b>Pezzola</b> 
                had an established relationship with other,
                higher-ranking Proud Boys, like <b>Charles Donohoe</b> and <b>Enrique Tarrio</b>. The prosecution wanted the jury to conclude
                that <b>Pezzola</b> was
                a key conspirator who was methodically following orders from the <b>MOSD</b> leadership when he smashed the window, rather than just
                another random rioter engaging in <i>ad hoc</i> violence who happened to be among the first rioters to breach 
                the Capitol building.
                <br><br>
                The prosecution's suggestion that <b>Pezzola</b> smashed the upper terrace window pane as part of
                some elaborate plan, devised by the Proud Boys <i>in advance</i> of Jan 6, to storm the US Capitol building, is significantly weakened by the fact that
                <b>Pezzola</b> was merely one of <i>several</i> first-wave rioters on the upper terrace trying to force their way into the building. <b>Pezzola</b> was not
                even the first rioter to actually penetrate the glass (see <a href="PezzolaSmashingWindowPane-720.mp4"><b>video</b> of <b>Pezzola</b> smashing the window pane</a>)
                or enter the building, 
                and the opening <b>Pezzola</b> created by smashing the window pane was <i>not</i>
                even the same opening used by the first rioter who entered the building. (See the <a href="#anc16">above discussion about <b>Dominic Pezzola</b>
                and the unidentified <b>rioter in red</b></a>.)
                <br><br>
                <b>Dominic Pezzola</b> was ultimately the only Proud Boy acquitted of the <b>seditious conspiracy</b> charge.

                the world to see. <b>Enrique Tarrio</b> was not even trying to hide his support for the Jan 6 rioters, and likely had no inkling
                that this Parler post would later be used against him as evidence of a pre-planned <b>seditious conspiracy</b> to storm the Capitol.

                Included in the indictment to demonstrate that <b>Enrique Tarrio</b>, who was 
                not even present in DC on January 6,
                nonetheless approvingly watched the action unfold while
                communicating with other Proud Boys. This exchange on Telegram between <b>Enrique Tarrio</b>
                and rank-and-file Proud Boy <b>Chris Cannon</b> was particularly helpful to the prosecution's
                <b><i>seditious conspiracy</i></b> case.
                <b>Enrique Tarrio</b> outright said <i>“We did this...”</i> in a private Telegram chat, seemingly admitting to playing some role in
                causing or orchestrating the Jan 6 attack on the US Capitol building.
                <br><br>
                The indictment omits some context that somewhat dilutes the impact of <b>Tarrio's</b> incriminating “confession”.
                This exchange between <b>Enrique Tarrio</b> and <b>Chris Cannon</b> began when Cannon messaged Tarrio (casually using a racial slur
                in accordance with the Proud Boys' 4chan-inspired group culture) saying “<i>I told you we should have rushed the police on the 12th this could have been us</i>”.
                <b>Chris Cannon</b> was referring to an earlier incident that occurred on December 12, 2020,
                during the second “<b>Million MAGA March</b>” rally in Washington DC. During this earlier rally,
                the Proud Boys were attempting to fight with local anti-fascist (<b>Antifa</b>) counter-protester groups, but were
                blocked by the police who were <a href="https://sigsegv1980.github.io/j6/USParkPoliceEventPreBrief-DCProtestsOn9December2020-MillionMAGAMarch-ProudBoysvAntifa.pdf">
                tasked with keeping the Proud Boys physically separated from <b>Antifa</b></a> in order to prevent the two groups
                from violently fighting each other in the streets of DC. Some Proud Boys interpreted this as a signal that the
                police were <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20210110202951/https://parler.com/post/a49b582090254476b3258a5bf22635d4">willfully protecting</a> 
                (or siding with) <b>Antifa</b>, causing some Proud Boy leaders to begin to 
                <a href="#anc20">distrust and resent the DC police</a>. <b>Chris Cannon</b> tried to incite a group of Proud Boys to
                collectively rush a <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20201213041516/https://twitter.com/ShelbyTalcott/status/1337973625408942080">police defensive line</a> in order to 
                reach the group of counter-protesters (whom the Proud Boys believed were <b>Antifa</b>-affiliated) that had 
                <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20201213064426/https://apnews.com/article/election-2020-joe-biden-donald-trump-race-and-ethnicity-elections-dc8f6803f90f844177f324d374242cb6">amassed

                <br><br>
                <b>Chris Cannon's</b> message to <b>Enrique Tarrio</b> on January 6
                — "<i>I told you we should have rushed the police on the 12th this could have been us</i>" — references this

                It's worth pointing out that the above Telegram exchanges are yet more evidence that the Proud Boys were primarily concerned with
                fighting <b>Antifa</b> rather than attacking the police. Even the Proud Boys' increased animosity and violent rhetoric towards the police in December of 2020 was
                rooted in the ongoing Proud Boy conflict with <b>Antifa</b> (the Proud Boys believed 
                that the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20210110202951/https://parler.com/post/a49b582090254476b3258a5bf22635d4">DC cops sided with <b>Antifa</b>
                and <i>Black Lives Matter</i></a> on December 12, 2020
                after a group of counter-protesters <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20210110174004/https://video.parler.com/Mn/C2/MnC26VemEctP_small.mp4">withdrew 
                behind police lines</a>) rather than some secret conspiracy to attack cops and storm the Capitol. (See also the 
                <a href="https://sigsegv1980.github.io/j6/ProudBoys-OperationDCStreetSweepers-2020-12-19_2020-12-26.pdf#page=4">Telegram post from Proud Boy “<b>Deplorable51</b>”

                <br><br>
                Yet despite the Proud Boys' growing animosity towards the cops, the above conversation
                makes it clear that, at least as of December 30th, 2020, the Proud Boys still didn't think attacking cops was a good idea. Proud Boy <b>Twisted Zack</b> claims 
                he threatened to knock
                out a fellow Proud Boy who was attempting to incite others to attack the cops on December 12, 2020 during the MAGA rally in DC. Indeed, <b>Enrique Tarrio</b>
                himself was very concerned that <a href="https://sigsegv1980.github.io/j6/ProudBoys-SkullAndBonesChat-2020-9-29_2021-1-4.pdf#page=10">aggressive behavior 
                at national rallies could land the Proud Boys in serious trouble</a> (see Govt Exhibit <b>500-69</b>). That's
                the <i>entire reason</i> the <b>“Ministry of Self Defense” (MOSD)</b> chapter was created in the first place:

                And of course, during the <a href="https://youtu.be/9HY3IVStIJc?t=473"><b>MOSD Zoom call</b></a> 
                on December 30, 2020, <b>Enrique Tarrio</b> stressed that Proud Boys should <i>never</i>
                initiate conflicts or go on the offense, saying 
                <i>“I saw a lot of people going on the offense [on December 12th]. We’re not used to going on the offense — that’s why it’s called self-defense”</i>
                (timestamp <a href="https://youtu.be/9HY3IVStIJc?t=473"><b>7:53</b></a>).
                <b>Tarrio</b> later added <b><i>“we’re never gonna be the ones to cross the police barrier</b> or cross something in order to get to somebody. We’re always going 
                to be the one standing back, right? Um, and we’re always going to be the ones to fucking defend and we’ve been really good at it”</i> (timestamp 
                <a href="https://youtu.be/9HY3IVStIJc?t=2014"><b>33:29</b></a>).
                Indeed, Tarrio forced every <b>MOSD</b> member to fill out an <a href="https://sigsegv1980.github.io/j6/ProudBoys-MOSDMemberApplicationForm.pdf">
                <b>application form</b></a> affirming agreement with the stipulation
                <i><b>“I will always act in self defense and I will never initiate a confrontation”</b></i>.
                <br><br>
                Nevertheless, at face value, <b>Enrique Tarrio's</b> statement to <b>Chris Cannon</b> on January 6 
                that <b><i>“Make no mistake... we did this”</i></b> certainly seems incriminating. 
                While it's
                not exactly a smoking gun for the prosecution, it <i>is</i> the sort of thing
                <a href="https://www.vice.com/en/article/enrique-tarrio-proud-boys-jury/">a jury is likely to find to be compelling evidence</a>
                of advance planning for the Jan 6 attack. However, there was never any doubt that the Proud Boys <b><i>“did this”</i></b> (i.e. stormed the Capitol). They're on camera
                storming the Capitol. Moreover, <b>Enrique Tarrio</b> — the Proud Boys' chairman and leader — publicly
                <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20210110182922/https://parler.com/post/9917740632d048f3b645510e92cfa603">encouraged the Jan 6 rioters</a>
                on Parler while the Capitol riot was underway. But again, this doesn't mean the Proud Boys actually planned <i>in advance</i> to storm the Capitol. 
                When Tarrio said <b><i>“Make no mistake... we did this”</i></b>, he may simply have been boasting that the Proud Boys participated
                in the Capitol riot, exaggerating the centrality of their role for the sake of a good boast. Regardless, Tarrio's statement is open to
                interpretation. It's a data point
                that could reasonably be interpreted as supportive of the prosecution's <b>seditious conspiracy</b> case, and therefore it must
                be weighed against all the <a href="https://sigsegv1980.github.io/j6/ProudBoys-ExculpatoryChats.html"><i><b>exculpatory evidence</b></i></a> 
                suggesting no plan to storm the Capitol ever existed.
                <br><br>
                Moreover, part of the Telegram conversation between <b>Enrique Tarrio</b> and <b>Chris Cannon</b> was omitted in the indictment. This additional context
                somewhat weakens the impact of <b><i>“Make no mistake... we did this”</i></b>. Neither <b>Enrique Tarrio</b> 
                nor <b>Chris Cannon</b>
                were in Washington DC on January 6, but were watching from elsewhere as the Capitol riot unfolded. 
                Their Telegram conversation began at <b>2:28 PM</b> on January 6th, when <b>Cannon</b> said to <b>Tarrio</b> 
                <i>“hey i told you we should have rushed the police on the 12th this could have been us”</i>. Again,
                <b>Cannon</b> was referring to an incident back on December 12th, 2020, when Cannon tried (unsuccessfully) to convince other Proud Boys to
                rush a cordon of police officers
                (Govt Exhibits <a href="https://sigsegv1980.github.io/j6/ProudBoys-MOSDChat-2020-12-20_2021-1-4.pdf#page=27"><b>501-41</b></a> 
                and <a href="https://sigsegv1980.github.io/j6/ProudBoys-MOSDChat-2020-12-20_2021-1-4.pdf#page=30"><b>501-50</b></a>) 
                in order to reach a group of (possibly <b>Antifa</b>-affiliated) counter-protesters. 
                On January 6, as Cannon watched hundreds of people breach through police defensive lines, he perhaps felt somewhat vindicated 
                after taking flak from other Proud Boys for trying to rush a line of police back on December 12th, 2020. Now that
                “everyone was doing it”, <b>Chris Cannon</b> perhaps felt empowered to say to <b>Tarrio</b> the equivalent of something like <i>“See! I told you that rushing the cops
                was a viable idea but you didn't listen! We could have done it back on December 12th!”</i>
                <br><br>
                This “I told you so” also implies that <b>Chris Cannon</b> didn't necessarily <i>expect</i> hundreds of people to storm the Capitol building
                on January 6th, 
                and thus had no knowledge of any <i>pre-planning</i> to storm the Capitol. 
                Of course, <b>Chris Cannon</b> was not a <b>MOSD</b> leader and
                was never charged with <b>seditious conspiracy</b>, so his ignorance of a plan doesn't necessarily hurt the prosecution's case. But 
                <b>Chris Cannon's</b> statement that <i>“this could have been us”</i> implies he felt that the Proud Boys “missed out”
                on an opportunity back on December 12th when they refrained from rushing a police defensive line.
                Perhaps the implication is that <b>Cannon</b> believed the Proud Boys' unwillingness to escalate back on December 12th set a precedent which
                had now sidelined them, denying them a more central role in the (clearly historic) events that were unfolding on January 6th, 2021.
                <br><br>
                <b>Chris Cannon</b>'s
                rhetorical follow-up question <b><i>“are we a militia yet?”</i></b> is probably best interpreted to mean something
                along the lines of <i>“so does THIS [ongoing storming of the Capitol] finally 
                make us a proper militia?”</i> <b>Chris Cannon's </b>question pushed back against the sentiment, occasionally expressed by Proud Boy leadership, that 
                <i>“<a href="https://sigsegv1980.github.io/j6/ProudBoys-EastCoastRallyCommandChat.pdf#page=2"><b>We are not a fucking militia</b></a>”</i>
                (see Govt Exhibit <b>548-2</b>). Cannon's question also suggests he knew that at least some Proud Boys participated in
                the Jan 6 riot. But <b>Cannon's</b> earlier statement 
                that <b><i>“hey i told you we should have rushed the police on the 12th this could have been us”</i></b> implies he believed the Proud Boys 
                (or perhaps just <b>Tarrio</b> and <b>Cannon</b> personally)
                somehow “missed out” (either on December 12th or January 6th or both) by remaining unwilling to escalate and rush the police back on December 12th.
                <br><br>
                Regardless of the precise meaning of <b>Chris Cannon's</b> posts, <b>Enrique Tarrio</b> seems to have interpreted <b>Cannon's</b> 
                statement to mean that the Proud Boys' unwillingess to escalate and rush the police back on December 12 set a precedent that (presumably) 
                sidelined the Proud Boys on January 6 as the Capitol riot unfolded.
                Thus, <b>Tarrio's</b> reply to <b>Chris Cannon</b> (<b><i>“Make no mistake... we did this”</i></b>) should probably be interpreted to mean
                something along the lines of: <i>“Actually no, we [the Proud Boys] did NOT get sidelined. In fact, we were prominently involved in storming
                the Capitol today [on Jan 6]).”</i> This is less of a confession to conspiring in advance, and more of a boastful insistence (<i>“make no mistake”</i>) that 
                the Proud Boys <i>did</i>, in fact, play a significant role in storming the Capitol on January 6th. But the fact that the Proud Boys
                participated in storming the Capitol was never in doubt and never
                denied by the defense. Like so much of the ostensibly incriminating evidence presented by 
                the prosecution, <b>Tarrio's</b> statement merely demonstrates that the Proud Boys participated in and enthusiastically supported the Jan 6 attack, 
                but does <i>NOT</i> demonstrate that they actually conspired <i>in advance</i> to orchestrate the attack.

                present in DC on January 6, nonetheless conspired in advance of January 6 to orchestrate the attack on the US Capitol building. 
                These Parler posts, posted by <b>Enrique Tarrio</b> on the afternoon of January 6, also ostensibly support the prosecution's claim that <b>Enrique Tarrio</b> was influenced
                by the mysterious “<a href="https://sigsegv1980.github.io/j6/ProudBoys-1776Returns.pdf"><b>1776 Returns</b></a>” document, which 
                outlines an elaborate plan to occupy various government buildings near the US Capitol. (See 
                <a href="#anc17">above discussion on “1776 Returns”</a>.)
                The defense claimed that <b>Tarrio</b> likely never even read this document, which was sent to him by <b>Eryka Gemma</b> on Telegram on December 30, 2020.
                But the prosecution pointed to <b>Tarrio's</b> Parler posts which seem to reference certain details mentioned in 
                “<a href="https://sigsegv1980.github.io/j6/ProudBoys-1776Returns.pdf"><b>1776 Returns</b></a>”, such as the <b>Rayburn building</b>
                and the term <i><b>“1776”</b></i>.
                The indictment implies that when <b>Enrique Tarrio</b> posted <i><b>“1776”</b></i> publicly on Parler on the afternoon of January 6 
                while the Capitol riot was in progress, he was referencing the
                “<a href="https://sigsegv1980.github.io/j6/ProudBoys-1776Returns.pdf"><b>1776 Returns</b></a>” document.

                While it's possible that <b>Enrique Tarrio's</b> Parler post was referencing <b>“1776 Returns”</b>, this is by no means
                obvious or even necessarily likely. Throughout 2020, the term <b><i>“1776”</i></b> (the year America gained independence) was a common refrain, hashtag and

                Moreover, the <a href="https://sigsegv1980.github.io/j6/hashtag_counts_parler_2020.txt"><b>#1776</b> hashtag was used at least <b>14,448</b> times</a>

                among Trump supporters online, and thus the connection between Tarrio's <i><b>“1776”</b></i> Parler post and the <i><b>"1776 Returns"</b></i> 
                document is quite tenuous.

                The indictment also mentions a separate <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20210110202944/https://parler.com/post/5684061f826a4b4b8df2bb5de2dbda57">
                Parler post from <b>Enrique Tarrio</b></a> saying <i><b>“Revolutionaries are now at the Rayburn building”</b></i> which Tarrio
                posted on the afternoon of January 6 during the Capitol riot. 
                The <b>Rayburn building</b> is a House of Representatives office building about 
                <a href="https://www.google.com/maps/dir/U.S.+Capitol+Building,+Washington,+DC/Rayburn+House+Office+Building,+45+Independence+Ave+SW,+Washington,+DC+20515/@38.8885573,-77.0095647,18z/data=!3m1!4b1!4m14!4m13!1m5!1m1!1s0x89b7b82921a2cf17:0x482a3f7c10cf8c4!2m2!1d-77.0090505!2d38.8899389!1m5!1m1!1s0x89b7b82a08176c65:0xb10a45e70260e90a!2m2!1d-77.0105305!2d38.8871715!3e2?entry=ttu&g_ep=EgoyMDI0MTIwMy4wIKXMDSoASAFQAw%3D%3D">
                half a mile from the US Capitol building</a>.
                The indictment points out that the <b>Rayburn building</b> was
                specifically mentioned in the “<a href="https://sigsegv1980.github.io/j6/ProudBoys-1776Returns.pdf"><b>1776 Returns</b></a>” document,
                suggesting that <b>Tarrio</b> read <i><b>“1776 Returns”</b></i> and used it as a playbook to orchestrate the Capitol riot on January 6. 
                <br><br>
                Regardless, no rioters or “revolutionaries” ever <i>actually</i> stormed the <b>Rayburn building</b> on Jan 6, so
                why did <b>Tarrio</b> falsely or mistakenly claim they did on Parler? <b>Enrique Tarrio</b>
                was not actually in Washington DC on January 6th, 
                but he followed media coverage of the Capitol riot as it unfolded, <a href="https://sigsegv1980.github.io/j6/ZenodoParlerDump-NobleLeadPosts-2020.html#post_2174">
                posting on Parler throughout the afternoon
                of January 6th</a>. In fact, about one minute before <b>Tarrio</b> posted that rioters were <i>“at the Rayburn building”</i>, he posted a 
                <a href="https://sigsegv1980.github.io/j6/ZenodoParlerDump-NobleLeadPosts-2020.html#post_2177">photograph of one of
                the rioters inside the 
                Senate chamber</a> in the US Capitol building. Therefore, it seems likely that <b>Tarrio</b> knew the riot was happening exclusively at the Capitol building, 
                and not at the <b>Rayburn building</b>.
                <br><br>
                One possible explanation is that <b>Tarrio</b> was confused by <a href="https://x.com/StollNews/status/1346897825553145863">tweets</a> 
                <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20210106201202/https://twitter.com/Call_Me_Dutch/status/1346912285315403780">mentioning a lockdown</a> in 
                <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20211111000153/https://twitter.com/TaylorPopielarz/status/1346901123295227904">the Rayburn building</a>. 
                Alternatively, it's possible <b>Tarrio</b> was intentionally spreading misinformation publicly on Parler in order to mislead
                or confuse law enforcement and help out the rioters. It wouldn't be the first time that <b>Tarrio</b> used misinformation strategically 
                in order to mislead an opponent. A week before January 6, 
                <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20201229170859/https://parler.com/post/c741b78505a54150bdf63d079952e8f0">
                Tarrio publicly announced on Parler</a> that <i>“the ProudBoys will turn out in record 
                numbers on Jan 6th”</i>. We know from the <a href="https://youtu.be/9HY3IVStIJc?t=577"><b>MOSD Zoom meeting</b> at timestamp <b>9:37</b></a> 
                that this was a strategic deception meant to make the Proud Boys <i>“appear bigger than what we are”</i>. Perhaps <b>Tarrio's</b>
                post about <i>“revolutionaries”</i> at the <b>Rayburn building</b> was a similar deception.
                <br><br>
                The prosecution argued that <b>Tarrio's</b> mention of the <b>Rayburn building</b> is strong evidence that he
                used the <i><b>“1776 Returns”</b></i> document as a playbook to storm the Capitol on January 6. This argument
                implicitly relies on the assumption that <b>Tarrio</b> would not be likely to mention the <b>Rayburn building</b> unless he
                read <i><b>“1776 Returns”</b></i>. That is, the prosecution believes that the <b>Rayburn building</b> is relatively obscure 
                and not part of the general
                background knowledge the average American is likely to possess. But <b>Tarrio</b> had regularly traveled to Washington DC
                for various rallies and political events throughout 2020, so it's not much of a stretch to imagine that <b>Tarrio</b> would
                be familiar with the <b>Rayburn building</b> whether or not he ever read <i><b>“1776 Returns”</b></i>. Indeed, in December
                of 2020, Trump supporters
                on Parler <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20210110195420/https://parler.com/post/23721ad336f242ff818d136070c424cd">independently called</a> for 
                <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20210110193457/https://parler.com/post/7b08edc6d9ef49b1b0475018167e1ed4">storming or occupying
                the <b>Rayburn building</b></a> and other Federal buildings, proving that the idea
                was not unique to <i><b>“1776 Returns”</b></i>.
                <br><br>
                Regardless, 
                in my opinion, it's likely that <b>Tarrio</b> did, in fact, <i>read</i> 
                <a href="https://sigsegv1980.github.io/j6/ProudBoys-1776Returns.pdf"><i><b>1776 Returns</b></i></a>. The document probably inspired <b>Tarrio's</b> use of melodramatic language 
                like <i>“revolutionaries”</i> and <i>“Winter Palace”</i>, both of which are linguistic outliers in the online MAGA-sphere, where
                the patriotic, libertarian ethos of the American Revolution holds a lot more ideological sway than Vladimir Lenin and his Bolshevik revolutionaries. 
                (However, Tarrio <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20201221181756/https://parler.com/post/3ea858d0194343ee9b3f6834afd88b4b">
                did call <b>Eryka Gemma</b> a “revolutionary”</a> back in October of 2020, well before he encountered <i><b>1776 Returns</b></i>,
                and <b>Eryka Gemma</b> herself <a href="https://youtu.be/ZQawR_tbIC8?t=16749">used the word “revolutionary” during an interview</a>
                in December of 2020.)
                But given
                the <i>complete lack</i> of any references to <i><b>1776 Returns</b></i> or the plan outlined therein among
                all the <b>MOSD</b> Telegram groups and the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9HY3IVStIJc"><b>MOSD Zoom meeting</b></a>, 
                and the fact that the actual events of January 6 were fundamentally different from the
                multi-building <i>“sit-ins”</i> described in <i><b>1776 Returns</b></i>, <b>Tarrio's</b> mention of the <b>Rayburn building</b>
                doesn't prove anything beyond the fact that he may have read <i><b>1776 Returns</b></i> at some point. Moreover, the idea
                of storming or occupying the <b>Rayburn building</b> isn't unique to <i><b>1776 Returns</b></i> anyway. The same idea

                As <a href="#anc43">discussed above</a>, the term <b><i>“1776”</i></b> (the year America gained independence) was a popular rallying cry and hashtag among the online MAGA-sphere,
                appearing in at least <a href="https://sigsegv1980.github.io/j6/ParlerPostsWith1776.html"><b>22,143</b> Parler posts throughout 2020</a>.
                The term <i>“1776”</i> was <a href="https://sigsegv1980.github.io/j6/EnriqueTarrio-ParlerPostsWith1776.html">used by <b>Enrique Tarrio</b> himself</a> 
                on multiple occasions well before Trump lost the 2020 election, and thus well before 
                the Proud Boys had any conceivable motivation to storm the Capitol building. Thus, any connection between the Proud Boys' 
                use of the term <b><i>“1776”</i></b> on social media and the <i><b>“1776 Returns”</b></i> document is incredibly tenuous. The fact that some 
                Proud Boys incorporated <b><i>“1776”</i></b> into their celebratory
                Parler posts on January 6 proves nothing other than the fact that they enthusiastically supported the Jan 6 rioters.
                <br><br>
                While this Telegram exchange between <b>Jeremy Bertino</b> and <b>Enrique Tarrio</b> certainly proves
                that the <b>MOSD</b> leadership enthusiastically <i>supported</i> the Jan 6 rioters and the storming of the US Capitol building,
                this was never in doubt and the defense never argued otherwise. But again, this Telegram conversation does <i>not</i> prove
                that the Proud Boys actually planned <i>in advance</i> to storm the US Capitol building on January 6, and there is a large
                body of <a href="https://sigsegv1980.github.io/j6/ProudBoys-ExculpatoryChats.html"><b>exculpatory evidence</b></a> that strongly indicates no such plan ever existed.
                <br><br>
                The prosecution would argue that <b>Jeremy Bertino</b>'s statement <i><b>“you know we made this happen”</b></i> is evidence
                that the Proud Boys made plans in advance of Jan 6 to storm the US Capitol building. The defense would argue that this statement
                merely reflects <b>Bertino's</b> enthusiasm and pride over the fact that the Proud Boys participated in storming the US Capitol,
                and that <i>“we made this happen”</i> is best interpreted as a boastful expression of pride that exaggerates
                the role of the Proud Boys in the attack on the Capitol. Statements like this are
                open to interpretation, and therefore must be weighed against the large body of 
                <a href="https://sigsegv1980.github.io/j6/ProudBoys-ExculpatoryChats.html"><b>exculpatory evidence</b></a> supporting the
                conclusion that the Proud Boys never devised any plan in advance of Jan 6 to storm the Capitol. For example, <b>Zach Rehl</b>, a <b>MOSD</b>
                leader who, unlike <b>Jeremy Bertino</b>, was actually <i>present</i> in Washington DC on January 6, 2021, clearly and unambiguously stated, in a private
                Telegram group chat he believed to be secure, that what happened on Jan 6
                was <i>totally <b>unexpected</b></i> and therefore not part of any pre-conceived plan:
                <br><br>
                <div class="message">
                    Zach Rehl (Captain Trump) <span class="in-reply">[on <a href="https://sigsegv1980.github.io/j6/ProudBoys-BootsOnTheGroundChat.pdf#page=14">Telegram in <b>Boots on the Ground</b></a>]:
                    <div class = "message-body">
                        <b>That was NOT what I expected to happen today</b>, 😂.  All from us showing up and

                    </div>
                </div>
                However, the fact that <b>Enrique Tarrio</b> used the phrase <i>“The Winter Palace”</i> while celebrating what happened on January 6,
                certainly requires some further analysis. The phrase <i>“The Winter Palace”</i>, borrowed from the history of the 1917 Bolshevik Revolution
                in Russia, appeared in the <i>“<a href="https://sigsegv1980.github.io/j6/ProudBoys-1776Returns.pdf"><b>1776 Returns</b></a>”</i> document that 
                <b>Eryka Gemma</b> sent to <b>Enrique Tarrio</b> as an attachment on Telegram on December 30, 2020. (See 
                <a href="#anc17">above discussion about <i><b>“1776 Returns”</b></i></a>).
                The defense argued that <b>Tarrio</b> likely never even read the document, since there was no definitive proof that he actually opened the
                <a href="https://sigsegv1980.github.io/j6/ProudBoys-TarrioDMsAndGroupChats-2020-12-19_2021-1-4.pdf#page=10">attachment on Telegram</a>. 
                However, this is one instance where the defense's position is weak. <b>Enrique Tarrio</b> used
                terminology like <i>“The Winter Palace”</i> and <i>“<a href="#anc43">revolutionaries</a>”</i>, both of which are linguistic
                outliers in the online MAGA-sphere (where the patriotic ethos of the American Revolution has a lot more ideological sway than
                Vladimir Lenin and his Bolshevik revolutionaries), supporting the conclusion that <b>Tarrio</b> very likely at least <i>read</i>
                <i><b>“1776 Returns”</b></i> at some point. Moreover, <b>Tarrio</b>
                <a href="https://sigsegv1980.github.io/j6/ProudBoys-CellebriteExtractionShowingTarrioGoogleTheWinterPalace.jpg">
                Googled the phrase <b><i>“the winter palace”</i></b></a> on January 1, 2021, a day after <b>Eryka Gemma</b>
                sent it to him on Telegram, suggesting that <b>Tarrio</b> read <i><b>1776 Returns</b></i> but wasn't 
                familiar with the historical significance of the <i>“Winter Palace”</i>.
                <br><br>
                But this evidence hardly proves that <b>Enrique Tarrio</b> actually used <i><b>“1776 Returns”</b></i> as some kind of playbook
                for orchestrating the attack on the US Capitol on Jan 6. There are <b>zero</b> references to <i><b>“1776 Returns”</b></i> or the plan outlined therein 
                among all the <b>MOSD</b> Telegram evidence and the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9HY3IVStIJc"><b>MOSD Zoom meeting</b></a>. 
                Additionally, the <i>actual</i> events of January 6 were fundamentally 
                different from the plan proposed in “<i><a href="https://sigsegv1980.github.io/j6/ProudBoys-1776Returns.pdf"><b>1776 Returns</b></a></i>”, 
                which described coordinated peaceful <i>sit-ins</i> across multiple
                government buildings (<i><b>not</b></i> including the Capitol building), rather than a frontal attack focused exclusively on the US Capitol 
                building implemented by riling up a crowd of “normie”
                Trump supporters. Finally, a large
                body of <a href="https://sigsegv1980.github.io/j6/ProudBoys-ExculpatoryChats.html"><b>exculpatory evidence</b></a> 
                strongly indicates there was never any plan conceived in advance of January 6 to attack the US Capitol.

                Included in the indictment because it
                contains a vaguely threatening black and white video of <b>Enrique Tarrio</b> ominously standing in front of the US Capitol building. The caption,
                reading <b><i>“premonition”</i></b>, suggests a foreshadowing of future events.
                This video was posted publicly on Parler,
                late at night on January 6 at <b>11:16 PM</b>, several hours <i>after</i> the Capitol riot ended. However, since <b>Enrique Tarrio</b> was not present in Washington DC
                on January 6, 2021, the video must have been created some time <i>before</i> January 6 when <b>Tarrio</b> was in DC. Therefore, the prosecution 
                argued that 
                the video is
                incriminating because it appears to foreshadow the Jan 6 attack on the Capitol building. 
                <br><br>
                But even if the video was created
                prior to January 6, the <i>caption</i> reading <i><b>“premonition”</b></i> was posted <i>after</i> the Capitol riot ended, 
                thus diluting the impact of this post as an incriminating prognosis of future events.
                Moreover, <b>Enrique Tarrio</b> has on multiple occasions posted similarly cryptic and
                <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20201229170859/https://parler.com/post/c741b78505a54150bdf63d079952e8f0">vaguely threatening messages on social media</a>
                with a flair for the dramatic. For example,
                <b>Tarrio</b> also <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20230523110559/https://t.me/MiamiProudBoys/176">posted another message
                on
                Telegram that appears to foreshadow the Jan 6 Capitol attack</a> in a much more obvious manner. In that post, a photograph 
                shows Tarrio standing alone in front 
                of the US Capitol building. Underneath is a caption reading “<i><b>I'm home. #Soon”</b></i>.
                <br><br>
                <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20230523110559/https://t.me/MiamiProudBoys/176">
                <img src="2019TelegramPostFromMiamiProudBoys-TarrioPosingByCapitol.png"/>
                </a>
                <br><br>
                Seems pretty damning, right? Except, that post <i><b>wasn't</b></i> included in the indictment, because 
                <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20230523110559/https://t.me/MiamiProudBoys/176"><b>Enrique Tarrio</b> posted it way back in November of 2019</a>,
                well before Donald Trump lost the 2020 election and thus well before the Proud Boys had any conceivable motive to storm the US Capitol building.
                Obviously, <b>Enrique Tarrio</b> had no plan to storm the US Capitol building back in 2019, and no prosecutor could possibly argue otherwise.
                Yet <b>Tarrio</b> nonetheless still posted this ominous photo and caption on Telegram back in 2019. Thus, we can conclude either that <b>Tarrio</b> is clairvoyant
                or owns a time machine, or that he's just a provocative guy who enjoys getting attention from posting vaguely threatening, cryptic messages on social media.
                <b>Tarrio's</b> <a href="https://sigsegv1980.github.io/j6/ZenodoParlerDump-NobleLeadPosts-2020.html">posting history</a> suggests we should not read too 
                deeply into these sort of cryptic messages because they are
                likely just a form of marketing. Indeed, <b>Tarrio</b> described his own job title in the <b>“Ministry of Self Defense”</b> (<b>MOSD</b>) chapter as
                “<a href="https://sigsegv1980.github.io/j6/ProudBoys-MOSD-Main-2020-12-27_2021-1-4.pdf#page=8"><b>Marketing</b></a>” (see Govt Exhibit <b>503-18</b>).

                This Telegram post from <b>MOSD</b> leader <b>John Charles Stewart</b> (<b>Johnny Blackbeard</b>) was <i>not</i> included in the indictment, most likely because 
                <b>Johnny Blackbeard</b> was not present in Washington DC on January 6 and was never charged with
                <b>seditious conspiracy</b>. However, this post is perhaps the clearest statement from a Proud Boy
                that seems to lend support to the prosecution's theory that the Proud Boys planned the
                attack on the Capitol building in advance of January 6, and orchestrated the attack by riling up a mob of “normie” Trump supporters in order
                to use them as a battering ram to breach the police defensive lines and storm the
                Capitol building. <b>Johnny Blackbeard</b> posted this on the morning of January 7th, 2021. The incriminating content
                of this post suggests that on the day after January 6th, the Proud Boys were still
                not too concerned about the possibility of their Telegram messages being recovered and used against them
                by law enforcement. (Although this attitude <a href="https://sigsegv1980.github.io/j6/ProudBoys-NewMOSD-2021-1-4_2021-1-13.pdf#page=36">would soon change by January 8th</a>.
                See Govt Exhibit <b>509-41</b>.)
                <br><br>
                <b>Johnny Blackbeard</b>'s post suggests, at the very least, that some of the Proud Boys leadership
                wholeheartedly supported the Jan 6 Capitol riot. Again, there was never any doubt that the Proud Boys
                enthusiastically supported the Jan 6 rioters, and the defense never argued otherwise. But their enthusiasm
                and support for the storming of the Capitol does not prove the Proud Boys actually <i>planned in
                advance</i> of January 6 to storm the Capitol building. However, <b>Johnny Blackbeard</b>'s statement that
                <i>“we needed [the normie Trump supporters] to step up”</i> can easily be
                framed as evidence supporting the prosecution's <b>seditious conspiracy</b> case, because it suggests
                the Proud Boys were specifically <i>relying</i> on “normie” pro-Trump protesters to storm and occupy the Capitol building.
                Interpreting <b>Johnny Blackbeard</b>'s statement as indicating <i>reliance</i> on the “normies” 
                suggests the corollary that the Proud Boys had a plan, devised in advance of January 6, that
                <i>relied</i> on the presence of a large crowd of “normies”.
                <br><br>
                Of course, the defense would argue that <b>Johnny Blackbeard</b>'s statement about <i>“need[ing] [the normies] to step up”</i> does not 
                prove advance planning, but merely proves that <i>after</i> the Capitol riot, <b>Johnny Blackbeard</b> realized
                the missed opportunity and lamented that the “normies” failed to occupy the building or act cohesively towards a
                political objective. However, in my opinion, a reasonable person might interpret <b>Johnny Blackbeard</b>'s post as
                supportive of the prosecution's <b>seditious conspiracy</b> case. At least in isolation.
                <br><br>
                But after examining the wider context surrounding <b>Johnny Blackbeard</b>'s Telegram post, a reasonable person would likely
                arrive at the <i>polar opposite</i> conclusion. In fact, I included this
                Telegram post from <b>Johnny Blackbeard</b> — which again was <i>not</i> included in the indictment — because it demonstrates
                how evidence that initially appears to <i>support</i> the prosecution's case can sometimes be rendered a lot <i>less</i> persuasive
                after being reevaluated in light of additional context. The day after January 6, about 30 minutes <i>before</i> <b>Johnny Blackbeard</b> posted
                the seemingly incriminating message about how the normies needed <i>“to step up”</i>, he participated in

                This suggests, with <i>significantly more</i> clarity and significantly <i>less</i> room for interpretation, that as far 
                as <b>Johnny Blackbeard</b> was concerned, there was <b>never <i>“really a plan”</i></b>. And <b>Jeremy Bertino</b>,
                another <b>MOSD</b> leader, agreed with <b>Johnny Blackbeard</b>, saying
                there was <i>“definitely not enough planning for this <b>rally</b>”</i>. Tellingly, <b>Bertino</b> referred to the <i>object</i> of
                the planning for January 6 as a <b><i>“rally”</i></b>
                rather than something like an “operation” or “mission”, providing us with an important insight into how <b>MOSD</b> leadership viewed
                the purpose of traveling to DC on January 6. This suggests the Proud Boys initially viewed January 6 as just another
                national rally, similar to all the other rallies the Proud Boys attended throughout 2020, rather than a uniquely
                special operation to storm the Capitol. (This is consistent with <b>Jeremy Bertino's</b> earlier statement
                on the morning of January 5th, referring to a <a href="https://sigsegv1980.github.io/j6/ProudBoys-NewMOSD-2021-1-4_2021-1-13.pdf#page=10">plan for 
                “<b>the rally</b> tomorrow”</a>, rather than something like the “mission” or “operation” tomorrow.)
                <br><br>
                <b>Jeremy Bertino</b> continued, saying that the lack of planning for the rally could be attributed to the fact that the Proud Boys
                were <b><i>“busy trying to set this thing up”</i></b>. As tempting as it may be for the prosecution to interpret <i>“set <b>this thing</b> up”</i> as a reference
                to some secret plan to storm the Capitol, the overall context makes it obvious that <i><b>“this thing”</b></i> refers to
                the new <b>Ministry of Self Defense (MOSD)</b> chapter, which was established specifically 
                <a href="https://sigsegv1980.github.io/j6/ProudBoys-SkullAndBonesChat-2020-9-29_2021-1-4.pdf#page=10">to curtail aggressive behavior</a> (Govt Exhibit <b>500-69</b>) 
                from rank-and-file Proud Boys at national rallies, and was intended to be rolled out for a trial-run on January 6, 2021.
                (See <a href="#anc11">above discussion on the purpose of the <b>MOSD</b> chapter</a>.) <b>Enrique Tarrio</b>
                stated explicitly that the <b>MOSD</b> chapter will be <a href="https://sigsegv1980.github.io/j6/ProudBoys-MOSD-MAIN-FullChatMessages-2020-12-27_2021-1-1.pdf#page=118">
                running <i>“training exercises”</i> during <i>“the 5th at night and 6th throughout the day”</i></a>
                and that <i>“<a href="https://sigsegv1980.github.io/j6/ProudBoys-MOSD-Main-2020-12-27_2021-1-4.pdf#page=8">we are going to be using the 
                6th as a test</a> [of the new <b>MOSD</b> policies]”</i>
                (see Govt Exhibit <b>503-18</b>).
                <br><br>
                The starkly different conclusions we naturally arrive at when evaluating <b>Johnny Blackbeard</b>'s seemingly incriminating Telegram post
                <i>in isolation</i> versus evaluating the post within the <i>larger context</i> of the ongoing dialogue in the Telegram group chat, 
                demonstrates the paramount importance of <i>context</i> when evaluating the Telegram and Parler evidence presented as incriminating.
                Thus, <b>Johnny Blackbeard</b>'s seemingly incrimating admission that <b><i>“we needed [the normies] to step up”</i></b> must be
                evaluated in light of his <i>other</i> statement, posted 30 minutes earlier in the same Telegram group chat, where he 
                said <i><b>“I don't think there ever was really a plan. ... We were
                caught off guard for sure”</i></b>. A synthesis of both statements favors the defense's interpretation of <b>Johnny Blackbeard</b>'s
                statement about the normies “stepping up”: <b>Johnny Blackbeard</b> was simply lamenting a missed opportunity <i>after the fact</i>,
                not referring to some secret plan devised <i>in advance</i> of January 6 to storm the Capitol.
