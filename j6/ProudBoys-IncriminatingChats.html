                Included in the indictment to establish that the Proud Boys were angry about the outcome of the 2020 Presidential election, which they believe was
                stolen, and that they often expressed their anger using violent rhetoric. Meant to establish motive, obviously.
                <br><br>
                The indictment omits the part of <b>Joe Biggs'</b> post that grounds his threat about "fucking War" in a more specific
                historical context. Biggs is likely refering to media reports at the time (whether "fake news" or not) that were claiming that Republican election monitors 
                were blocked from effectively monitoring the vote count in certain locales.

                histrionic claim
                that <i>"[Proud Boys in DC are] approaching black people with handcuffs and threatening to kidnap folk"</i> and suggesting
                that "<i>KILL FIRST ASK LATER</i>" is an appropriate counter-measure. Tarrio's post is meant to ironically
                juxtapose the media focus on violent behavior from the Proud Boys with violent rhetoric coming from a political 
                enemy of the Proud Boys.

                Included in the indictment to emphasize that the Proud Boys upped their recruitment efforts in response to the
                announcement of the upcoming Jan 6 rally in DC, and that they were interested in getting <i>"radical"</i> and recruiting <i>"real men"</i>, 
                suggesting to the jury that the Proud Boys were now interested mostly in recruiting people who are willing to engage in 
                political violence. This is also meant to suggest to the jury that the
                Proud Boys started conspiring to storm the Capitol as early as <b>December 19, 2020</b>, beginning with a ramped up recruitment
                effort. 
                <br>
                <br>
                The indictment omits <b>Joe Biggs'</b> follow up posts 12 seconds later. Biggs seems to clarify that he didn't mean anything
                in a <i>"crazy way"</i>, but the meaning of Biggs' post is ambiguous due to the typo. Further clarifying posts from
                Biggs somewhat soften the impact of <i>"get radical and [recruit] real men"</i> by clarifying that Biggs mostly meant that the
                Proud Boys <i>"need to portray a more masculine vibe"</i> that better reflects how the Proud Boys see themselves. Biggs seems 
                primarily concerned with how the Proud Boys are <i>perceived</i>, which is appropriate given that Biggs was put in charge 
                of "marketing" later that week when the <b>MOSD</b> chapter was established. However, Biggs' focus on public perception is 
                of course compatible with the intended takeaway of this evidence, which is that Biggs (and by extension, the Proud Boys collectively)
                began to recruit <i>"real men"</i> willing to <i>"stand up and fight"</i> (i.e. engage in political violence).
                <br>
                <br>
                However, <b>Enrique Tarrio</b> never responds to anything Biggs says here, so the exhibit doesn't really demonstrate that the Proud Boys
                actually ramped up recruitment efforts in any significant way specifically in preparation for Jan 6.

                        31. On December 20, 2020, PERSON-3 posted a message to the MOSD Leaders Group
                        that stated, “I am assuming most of the protest will be at the capital building given what's going
                        on inside.” In response, TARRIO proposed a video chat, which would take place on December 21,
                        to discuss the MOSD and January 6.

                Included in the indictment to suggest to the jury that the Proud Boys were focused on the US Capitol building as early as 12/20/2020, and
                to establish that the Proud Boys were making plans and having Zoom meetings about Jan 6 at that time. 
                <br>
                <br>
                However, like most of the prosecution's evidence, these Telegram posts merely establish that the Proud Boys were planning <i>something</i>, 
                but do nothing to establish <i>WHAT</i> the Proud Boys were planning. For a typical jury member, or anyone unfamiliar with the
                the history of the Proud Boys and political rallies throughout 2020, it's easy to read these posts and assume (due to basic <i>confirmation bias</i>) that
                any discussion about planning for Jan 6, or any mention of the Capitol building, automatically <i>confirms</i> the prosecution's <b>seditious conspiracy</b> case. After 
                all, what <i>else</i> would the Proud Boys be planning on doing there, if not storming the Capitol?
                <br>
                <br>
                But the indictment misleadingly omits significant historical context here that reveals this exchange to be nothing more than typical
                event planning. There were MANY rallies attended by the Proud Boys throughout 2020. 
                In November and December, many of these rallies were organized by a <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20201231183223/https://stopthesteal.us/">coalition of 
                conservative activist loosely united under the "Stop The Steal" slogan/hashtag</a>, including two rallies in Washington D.C. on 
                <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20201118012633/https://www.washingtonpost.com/dc-md-va/2020/11/14/million-maga-march-dc-protests/">November 14</a> 
                and <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20201212160205/https://www.nbcwashington.com/news/local/trump-supporters-maga-rally-protest-dc-saturday/2506267/">December 12</a>, both of
                which were very similar to Jan 6. When the Proud Boys attended a rally, their activities typically involved 
                <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20210110164843/https://video.parler.com/uY/Nb/uYNb0PwARkgL_small.mp4">marching through the streets chanting

                for <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20201126081012/https://parler.com/post/e475993d3f834a46acba44a212f4142d">high-profile conservatives</a> and/or 
                <a href="https://x.com/SRodd_CPR/status/1330258072678363143">ordinary pro-Trump protesters</a>.
                <br>
                <br>
                This is why <b>Johnny Blackheard</b>
                asked <b>Enrique Tarrio</b> "<i>what locations do you absolutely need to stop at?</i>". Blackbeard believed it was likely that Tarrio would
                be giving a speech on stage on Jan 6, which would necessarily affect overall plans for that day, especially given 
                <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20201002154105/https://www.nytimes.com/2020/10/02/us/elections/the-florida-director-of-a-pro-trump-latino-group-is-the-chairman-of-the-proud-boys.html">Tarrio's association with Latinos for Trump</a>, 
                an organization that <a href="https://sigsegv1980.github.io/j6/LatinosForTrumpJan6Flyer.pdf">reserved a stage on Jan 6 near the US Capitol in order to hold a 
                protest/demonstration</a>. Blackbeard then mentions 
                his belief that the protest would mostly be centered around the Capitol building. Far from suggesting any seditious plans, Blackbeard's statement 
                here is simply a reasonable assumption, given that:
                <ul>
                    <li>Congress would be meeting in the Capitol, thus any protesters are likely to congregate near the Capitol</li>
                    <li>
                        Most previous "Stop The Steal" protests took place 
                        <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20201231183223/https://stopthesteal.us/">outside State Capitol buildings or the US Capitol</a>
                    </li>
                    <li>Early <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20201223062953/https://wildprotest.com/">event flyers announcing the Jan 6 rally mentioned the US Capitol grounds</a> 
                    as the main location where various MAGA protests would be held. This was before
                    it was known that President Trump would be speaking at the Ellipse.
                    </li>
                </ul>
                <br>
                The indictment also uses misleading language to suggest that Tarrio setup the Zoom meeting <i>IN RESPONSE</i> to Blackbeard's statement about the
                Capitol, thereby subtly connecting the Capitol building to whatever the Proud Boys discussed during that Zoom call. But Tarrio's response
                came over 20 minutes after Blackbeard's comment, and could just as easily be interpreted as responding to Blackbeard's earlier post asking where Tarrio 
                "<i>absolutely need[s] to stop at</i>" on Jan 6.

                Included in the indictment to suggest to the jury that the <b>"Ministry of Self Defense" (MOSD)</b> chapter, created by
                Proud Boy chairman <b>Enrique Tarrio</b>, was a strict chapter with a militaristic structure, created mostly 
                for the purpose of planning to storm the US Capitol on Jan 6. The indictment focuses on the rigidly non-democratic 
                nature of MOSD, exemplified by the catch-phrase <b><i>"fit in or fuck off"</i></b>.
                <br><br>
                The Proud Boys as an organization is <a href="https://sigsegv1980.github.io/j6/ProudBoysConstitutionAndBylaws.pdf">divided into semi-autonomous regional chapters</a>.
                <b>MOSD</b> was a new national-level chapter of the 
                Proud Boys (with multiple associated Telegram chat groups) created on December 20, 2020.
                The indictment oversells the level of strictness enforced by Tarrio and the MOSD leadership. It was certainly no
                democracy, as is clear from the 
                <a href="https://sigsegv1980.github.io/j6/ProudBoys-MOSDProspectsSmall.pdf">initial announcement on Telegram informing other Proud Boys of the new MOSD chapter</a>.
                However, the tone and verbiage used by MOSD leaders <b>Zach Rehl</b> and <b>Enrique Tarrio</b> during the <b><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9HY3IVStIJc">
                12/30/2020 MOSD Zoom meeting</a></b> (<a href="https://sigsegv1980.github.io/j6/ProudBoys-2020-12-30-MOSDZoomMeetingTranscript.pdf">full transcript</a>)
                reveals that the MOSD chapter wasn't always quite as strict as the indictment would have us believe:

                The phrase "<b>fit in or fuck off</b>" first appeared on the <b><a href="https://sigsegv1980.github.io/j6/ProudBoys-MOSDMemberApplicationForm.pdf">MOSD 
                Application Form</a></b> that Tarrio required prospective members to sign before they were permitted to join MOSD. However, Tarrio only
                actually said this phrase once on Telegram (in the <a href="https://sigsegv1980.github.io/j6/ProudBoys-MOSD-MAIN-FullChatMessages-2020-12-27_2021-1-1.pdf">MOSD MAIN chat group</a>)
                when another Proud Boy named <b>Brien James</b> 
                criticized the structure of <b>MOSD</b> and disapproved of <b>Joe Biggs</b> being assigned a leadership role. <b>Enrique Tarrio</b>
                told Brien James to "Fit in...or fuck off". This was really the only occasion (at least on Telegram) where Tarrio strictly enforced
                anything in the <b>MOSD</b> chapter. Also, simply reading through a typical <a href="https://sigsegv1980.github.io/j6/ProudBoys-ExportedTelegramChatMOSDOp/messages.html">Proud Boy MOSD Telegram chat</a>
                - often filled with silly memes and vulgar jokes - should immediately dispel the notion that the Proud Boys were even capable of being
                particularly serious on a consistent basis.
                <br><br>
                The indictment also obscures the actual purpose of the <b>MOSD</b> chapter and the historical context that prompted its creation. The indictment
                suggests <b>MOSD</b> was created specifically to plan for storming the Capitol on Jan 6. But Telegram chats and 
                <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9HY3IVStIJc">video of the 12/30/2020 MOSD Zoom meeting</a> makes it absolutely clear that <b>MOSD</b> was 
                created to address discipline issues that occurred during previous rallies in Washington DC, specifically the 
                <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20201212160205/https://www.nbcwashington.com/news/local/trump-supporters-maga-rally-protest-dc-saturday/2506267/">December 12th, 2020 rally</a> 
                where Proud Boy <b>Jeremy Bertino</b> (NobleBeard on Telegram) was stabbed and Tarrio had difficulty maintaining control of hundreds of
                Proud Boys as they marched in formation through the streets of Washington DC. Thus, during
                the <a a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9HY3IVStIJc">12/30/2020 Zoom meeting</a>, when <b>Jeremy Bertino</b> emphasized the strictness of 
                <b>MOSD</b> (repeating the catch-phrase "fit in or fuck off"),
                he <i>also</i> explained <i>why</i> the new <b>MOSD</b> chapter was so strict, and it had nothing to do with any plans to storm a Capitol:

                <b>Enrique Tarrio</b> says that the MOSD will be running "<i>training exercises</i>" during "<i>the 5th at night and 6th throughout the day</i>".
                This is obviously not particularly compatible with the prosecution's seditious conspiracy case. 
                However, it <i>is</i> quite consistent with Tarrio's announcement posted the next day (12/29/2020) in the
                <a href="https://sigsegv1980.github.io/j6/ProudBoys-MOSD-MAIN-FullChatMessages-2020-12-27_2021-1-1.pdf">MOSD MAIN Telegram group</a>, where he said 
                <i>"we are going to be using the 6th as a test [of the new MOSD policies]"</i>.
                <br><br>
                Additionally, Tarrio also tells Group 2 to "<i>conduct themselves as gentlemen and always keep themselves in a self defense mindset</i>".
                This statement is also somewhat exculpatory, and therefore it was unsurprisingly excluded from the indictment.

                        The Washington Post for some reason believed that one of the many hotels we frequent was newsworthy. 
                        Because of this the hotel decided to close for 3 days. A hotel that prides itself with saying they haven’t 
                        closed their doors since it’s open in the 1920s. They have fallen victim to to the fake news. With @TheProudBoys 
                        you can see in real time the media machine do the globalists dirty work. The media is the ENEMY of the 
                        people. We had already stopped using the hotel as a hub 3 months ago. With the new ability I’ve being 
                        able to put 1000 boots on the ground we outgrew any single hotel.

                This Parler post was extremely important to the prosecution's seditious conspiracy case. In a public announcement on Parler,
                <b>Enrique Tarrio</b> informed his thousands of followers that the Proud Boys will
                <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20201229170859/https://parler.com/post/c741b78505a54150bdf63d079952e8f0">not be wearing their traditional
                black and yellow uniforms on January 6</a>, and will instead show up incognito (in plain clothes). Tarrio also suggests that some or
                all of the Proud Boys that show up in D.C. on January 6 will be dressed in all black.
                <br><br>
                Firstly, <b>Enrique Tarrio's</b> statement that the Proud Boys will <i>"spread across downtown DC in smaller teams"</i> is already mostly incompatible
                with the prosecution's <b>seditious conspiracy</b> case, because it's not really clear why spreading out in small teams "across downtown DC"
                makes any sense if the goal is to attack the Capitol building. The indictment glosses over this, focusing on the fact
                that the Proud Boys dressed incognito on Jan 6 instead of <i>"wearing Proud Boys colors that had been prominently displayed at previous events."</i>
                <br><br>
                Jan 6 was <i>not</i> the first time the Proud Boys considered showing up to an event without wearing the traditional
                black and yellow Proud Boy club colors. For example, back in September, 2020, before Trump even lost the election (and thus before
                the Proud Boys would have had any motive to storm the Capitol), one
                Proud Boy, concerned about increased public scrutiny after the Proud Boys were name-dropped on national television, 
                commented in a

                And in November of 2020, <b>Enrique Tarrio</b> forbade the Proud Boys from wearing their usual club colors

                Clearly, the Proud Boys occasionally had reasons to avoid wearing their usual club colors, even when not involved in any
                seditious conspiracies to storm Capitol buildings. Yet throughout the trial, the prosecution maintained that the Proud Boys dressed incognito on January 6th 
                expressly because
                they planned to storm the Capitol building and wanted to avoid being easily identified. The prosecution lumped 
                the "no colors" policy together with other preparations made by the Proud Boys in advance of Jan 6,
                including the fact that the Proud Boys came to D.C. with protective gear (body armor) and walkie-talkies,
                arguing that all of these preparations were part of a pre-planned conspiracy to attack the Capitol.

                    The seditious conspiracy began at least as early as December 19, 2020.
                    Tarrio, Nordean, Biggs, Rehl, and other leaders of the Proud Boys organization intentionally
                    recruited men prepared to engage in physical violence, if necessary. They organized a return to
                    Washington, D.C., which guidance included what to wear (e.g., no colors), what to bring (e.g.,
                    protective gear and communication equipment), and what to do (e.g., fit in or fuck off).

                This is one of the <i>least</i> defensible claims made by the prosecution. Firstly, the Proud Boys regularly

                Secondly, there is <i>overwhelming</i> evidence
                that preparations made by the Proud Boys for Jan 6 (including bringing protective gear and not wearing colors) was 
                <b>in anticipation of violent conflict with Antifa</b>, the Proud Boys' long-time street rivals at political rallies and protests.
                The term <b>"Antifa"</b> is an umbrella term referring to various regional <b>anti-fascist</b> or anarchist

                predicted that violent street fighting

                In Tarrio's Parler post, his emphasis on the word "black", as in <i>"we might dress in all <b>BLACK</b>"</i> and <i>"[t]he night calls

                posted this information <i>publicly</i> on Parler to confuse or intimidate Antifa, with the goal of ultimately being able
                to infiltrate or ambush Antifa. This interpretation is consistent with the fact that <b>Enrique Tarrio's</b> post
                ends with a cryptic remark, omitted in the indictment: <i>"48 Laws of Power #3 #4 #14 #15 #17 #29 #37 #39 #48"</i>. This is a 
                clear reference to the rules enumerated in <a href="https://www.amazon.com/48-Laws-Power-Robert-Greene/dp/0140280197">Robert Greene’s 48 Laws of Power</a>, 
                including Rule #3: <i>conceal your intentions</i>, Rule #14: <i>pose as a friend, work as a spy</i>, and Rule #17: <i>keep 
                others in suspended terror - cultivate an air of unpredictability.</i>
                <br><br>
                This interpretation is confirmed by the <b><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9HY3IVStIJc">December 30th, 2020 MOSD Zoom planning

                where <b>Enrique Tarrio</b> explained that the purpose of publicly announcing the "no colors" policy was to conceal the number
                of Proud Boys in D.C. on Jan 6, since Tarrio expected a significantly smaller number of Proud Boys (in comparison with previous D.C. rallies) 
                to attend.

                    [Transcribed audio]: So I'll give you the prime example - yesterday we had a little voice chat and we said
                    well, what we should do is scare the shit out of them and tell them that we're going to be dressed in
                    black, and it worked - it made headlines right because we're not going to have a lot of guys on the ground this
                    time, right, <b>we're not going to have a thousand proud boys on the ground, so we need to appear bigger than
                    what we are so</b>... um that's why we decided to go with that now.

                    <div class='timestamp'>12/30/20</div>
                    </div>
                </div>

                This is consistent with Proud Boy <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20210110193046/https://parler.com/profile/vigocarpathian">Bill Whicker III's Parler post</a>, 
                where he coyly says <i>"Maybe a few? 
                Maybe a thousand? <b>Antifa will never know.</b> They better think twice about attacking anyone this time. We are everywhere! Or are we?"</i>
                And it's also consistent with <a href="https://sigsegv1980.github.io/j6/ProudBoys-OfficialPresidentsChat-2020-8-7_2020-12-31.pdf">another statement from Tarrio on Telegram</a> 
                (see Govt Exhibit <b>514-47</b>) where he explains that one purpose of the "no colors" announcement on Parler was to cultivate fear among Antifa.
                And it's further corroborated by a <a href="https://sigsegv1980.github.io/j6/ProudBoys-MOSDChat-2020-12-20_2021-1-4.pdf">
                statement from <b>Joe Biggs</b> in the <b>MOSD</b> Telegram group</a> (see Govt Exhibit <b>501-12</b>), where he
                asks the other Proud Boys to avoid posting anything on social media prior to Jan 6 that would <i>"give away locations or our numbers"</i>.
                <br><br>
                All of this strongly suggests that the "no colors" policy was meant to enable the Proud Boys to avoid being recognized by <b>Antifa</b> on Jan 6. 
                This is the most natural, straightforward interpretation of the relevant Parler posts. Indeed, after Tarrio announced the "no colors" policy on Parler, 
                <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20210104151444/https://www.businessinsider.com/proud-boys-attend-january-6-dc-rally-incognito-all-black-2021-1">Business Insider published
                an article</a> about the Proud Boys that simply took it for granted that the purpose of showing up "incognito" on Jan 6 was to blend in with <b>Antifa</b>, since
                this is the most natural interpretation.
                <br><br>
                On top of all this, several posts from the private 
                <a href="https://sigsegv1980.github.io/j6/ProudBoys-ExportedTelegramChatMOSDOp/messages.html"><b>MOSD Ops Telegram chat group</b></a> make it <i>indisputably clear</i> that the purpose
                of the "no colors"/incognito policy was to avoid being recognized by <b>Antifa</b>. In this chat, the Proud Boys were
                discussing dressing up in all black like Antifa. Some Proud Boys even 
                <a href="https://sigsegv1980.github.io/j6/ProudBoys-ExportedTelegramChatMOSDOp/messages.html#go_to_message386">posted pictures on Telegram</a> 
                showing off their attempts to dress like Antifa
                by donning all-black attire and protective gear. Both <b>Joe Biggs</b> and <b>Enrique Tarrio</b> commented that blending in with Antifa
                convincingly would require certain Proud Boys to <b>hide their beards</b>, because (according to Biggs and Tarrio) Antifa members typically do not have beards:

                <b>These Telegram posts amount to <i>indisputable</i>, "smoking-gun" level evidence that the Proud Boys' purpose in showing up incognito in D.C. on Jan 6
                was to try to blend in with Antifa.</b>
                However, despite all this, the prosecution stubbornly maintained the position that the Proud Boys
                did not wear their normal colors on Jan 6 because they were planning to attack the police and storm the Capitol.

                Finally, there are numerous discussions across multiple Telegram chat groups where the Proud Boys talk about personal protective

                Clearly, the Proud Boys were very interested in acquiring stab proof vests because of <b>"recent events"</b> at the previous D.C. rally in December,
                when multiple Proud Boys 
                <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20201213043848/https://www.the-sun.com/news/1959359/million-maga-march-dc-trump-steal-election-stabbing/">were 
                stabbed while clashing with a counter-protester in the street</a>. The prosecution claimed that the Proud
                Boys brought equipment and body armor to D.C. on Jan 6 in preparation for attacking the police. But a stab proof vest is useless against
                the police, who, unlike <b>Antifa</b>, do not use knives.
                <br><br>
                To be fair to the prosecution, it's certainly possible that the Proud Boys' decision to not wear colors on Jan 6 was at least <i>partially</i>
                motivated by a desire to avoid the police to some extent, especially given the Proud Boys' increasing distrust and animosity towards the D.C. police
                after their experience at the previous D.C. rally on December 12, 2020 (see <a href="#anc20">below discussion about the Proud Boys' changing relationship with
                the police</a> prior to Jan 6). But the bulk of the Telegram evidence reveals that the "no color" policy was
                <i>mostly</i> an attempt to hide from and/or blend in with <b>Antifa</b>. In particular, there's no evidence the Proud Boys made any
                advance arrangements <i>specifically</i> to conceal their Jan 6 plans from the police, apart from basic OPSEC practices. 
                On the contrary, since 2019, <b>Enrique Tarrio</b> was 
                <a href="https://sigsegv1980.github.io/j6/TarrioExhibits-ShaneLamondTextMessages.pdf">regularly in contact
                with <b>D.C. Metro Police Officer Shane Lamond</b></a> (a fact Tarrio was <a href="https://sigsegv1980.github.io/j6/ReconstructionOfStateHeadLeadershipChat.pdf">
                quite open about with the other Proud Boys</a>), and Tarrio explicitly informed
                <b>Officer Lamond</b>, prior to January 6, that <a href="https://sigsegv1980.github.io/j6/ShaneLamondAndEnriqueTarrioMessagesAndCommunications.pdf">the Proud Boys would not 
                be wearing colors and would attend in small numbers on Jan 6</a> (see message from Tarrio to Lamond on 12/19/2020 at 10:59 AM). Thus, it's clear
                that Tarrio didn't mind if the police knew that the Proud Boys would be relatively "under-staffed" on Jan 6, which is yet further evidence
                that the "no colors" policy was mostly to avoid detection from <b>Antifa</b>.

                Included in the indictment to once again emphasize the "top down structure" and rigid, strict nature of the <b>MOSD</b> chapter, suggesting to the jury
                that the <b>MOSD</b> chapter was a militaristic organization created for the express purpose of storming the Capitol building. Additionally, this paragraph
                suggests that the <b>MOSD</b> chapter involved a sophisticated level of planning, with references to a multi-tier leadership structure
                with "Operations" and "Marketing" divisions. This shows evidence of planning, but does not show <i>WHAT</i> the Proud Boys were
                planning for Jan 6, again relying on <i>confirmation bias</i> to kick in and lead the jury to interpret any evidence of planning as evidence of a
                <b>seditious conspiracy</b> to storm the Capitol.
                <br><br>
                The indictment omits certain exculpatory or confusing parts of Tarrio's post, such as when he says <i>"we are going to be using the 6th as a test"</i>, which
                doesn't really fit the seditious conspiracy case.
                <br><br>
                More significantly, the indictment brings up the <i>"virtual meeting on December 30"</i>. This Zoom meeting (which lasted over an hour and a half) is
                <b><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9HY3IVStIJc">available on video in its entirety</a></b>. (See also the complete
                <a href="https://sigsegv1980.github.io/j6/ProudBoys-2020-12-30-MOSDZoomMeetingTranscript.pdf">transcript</a>). This video stands
                out as very significant <b>exculpatory evidence</b>. Throughout the entire hour and a half long discussion between <b>MOSD</b> leaders, including
                the "big 3" (Enrique Tarrio, Joe Biggs and Ethan Nordean), there is not a single mention of storming the Capitol or anything
                remotely similar. The meeting clarifies the <i>real</i> purpose of the MOSD chapter, which was to address disciplinary problems experienced during the 
                previous D.C. rally on December 14, when Proud Boy <b>Jeremy Bertino</b> was stabbed and <b>Enrique Tarrio</b> had difficulty maintaining control 
                of marching formations. During the meeting the Proud Boys discuss establishing new protocols (like splitting up into small groups) to make it easier 
                to stay in formation while marching through the streets during rallies.

                        bringing people back. I'm just fucking corralling everybody, right? Trying to keep everybody from

                rallying protocols instituted by the MOSD leadership, which entailed splitting into smaller 10 man groups (timestamp 16:59), not wearing the usual
                Proud Boy colors (timestamp 1:01:09), not getting drunk or high during the rally (4:40), and acting defensively at all times (timestamps 7:48, 32:03, 33:29).

                According to the prosecution, <b>Dominic Pezzola</b>, a Proud Boy from New York, was one of the first rioters to actually breach the Capitol
                building when he smashed a window with a riot shield (unrelated to the "decorative shield" mentioned in the indictment) that he had
                stolen from a police officer, enabling the first members of the mob of rioters to enter the building.

                    <div class="inner-blurb">
                        At approximately 2:13 p.m., PEZZOLA used the riot shield he had taken from a
                        Capitol Police officer to break a window of the Capitol. The first members of the mob entered the
                        Capitol through this broken window.
                    </div>
                </div>
                <b>Dominic Pezzola's</b> defense admitted that Pezzola smashed the window,
                but <a href="2023-08-06-USAvDominicPezzola-DefendantPezzolasReplyToUnitedStatesResponseToPezzolaRule29and33Motions.pdf">
                denied that Pezzola was the first person to actually breach the Capitol building</a> and also denied that the first members of the mob
                entered through a breach created by Pezzola. The defense claimed that an unidentified individual wearing a red cap, 
                glasses and a red sweater first smashed through the window, and that the first rioters entered through the breach
                created by this unidentified <b>rioter in red</b>. 
                <br><br>
                At face value, the prosecution's claim here about <b>Dominic Pezzola</b> has little relevance to the <b>seditious conspiracy</b> charges,
                because it has nothing to do with advance planning.
                Nonetheless, the prosecution's claim here is somewhat misleading, if not factually incorrect. The defense
                claimed that Pezzola was <i>NOT</i> the first rioter to breach the Capitol, and that the first members of the mob did
                <i>not</i> enter the Capitol building through a breach created by <b>Dominic Pezzola</b>, instead claiming that an 
                unidentified <b>rioter in red</b> was the first person to breach the Capitol and let in the mob. The defense's claim
                is actually corroborated by <b><a href="PezzolaSmashingWindowPane-720.mp4">video of the incident</a></b>, but the prosecution is not
                entirely wrong either, thanks to some clever wording in the indictment. 
                <br><br>
                In the video, we can
                see that the window in question is still undamaged at <b>0:08</b>. The window disappears from view after that, as the
                camera pans over to the left. Then at <b>0:16</b>, 
                the camera pans back to the window, and we see that the <b>right window pane</b> has been cracked. Then at <b>0:20</b>, someone dressed in red,
                wearing a red cap and a white surgical face mask, smashes through 
                the right window pane by hurling a thin board of wood like a spear. Finally, <b>Dominic Pezzola</b> comes along and smashes
                the <b>left window pane</b> using a riot shield around 20 seconds later at <b>0:40</b>.
                <br><br>
                <img width="60%" height = "60%" src = "pezzola-window1.png"><br>
                <img width="60%" height = "60%" src = "pezzola-window4.png"><br>
                <img width="60%" height = "60%" src = "pezzola-window5.png"><br>
                <img width="60%" height = "60%" src = "pezzola-window6.png"><br>
                <br><br>
                To be fair to the prosecution, the unidentified <b>rioter in red</b> smashed through the right window pane first, but didn't 
                completely clear away all the glass. <b>Dominic
                Pezzola</b> then came along and smashed through the <i>left</i> window pane using a riot shield, completely clearing away all the
                glass. Then the unidentified <b>rioter in red</b> cleared away the remaining glass from the <i>right</i> pane at <b>0:51</b>. So perhaps
                the question of who first "breached" the Capitol building is open to interpretation. The unidentified
                <b>rioter in red</b> smashed through the right window pane before Dominic Pezzola arrived. But <b>Dominic Pezzola</b> was the first 
                rioter to clear <i>enough</i> glass from the window pane to enable people to climb through. However, the first person to actually
                enter the Capitol building climbed through the <i><b>right</b></i> window pane at <b>0:57</b>. The right pane was
                smashed and cleared by the unidentified <b>rioter in red</b>, not Pezzola.
                <br><br>
                Regardless, Pezzola's direct message to <b>Enrique Tarrio</b> is included in the indictment most likely to suggest a close relationship between Tarrio
                and Pezzola. <b>Dominic Pezzola</b> ("Spazzo - 2nd°" on Telegram) was a rank-and-file Proud Boy rather than a leader with any authority or decision making power within
                the <b>MOSD</b> chapter. Pezzola clearly had never even met Tarrio at the time this message was sent on December 29, 2020, merely a week
                before January 6. Pezzola was rather late to the party, having become a Proud Boy less than two months before Jan 6
                (see <a href="https://sigsegv1980.github.io/j6/j6/2023-04-05-USAvProudBoys-TranscriptOfJuryTrial-Day60.pdf">trial testimony of Lisa Magee</a>), 
                and joining the 
                <a href="https://sigsegv1980.github.io/j6/ProudBoys-MOSD-Main-2020-12-27_2021-1-4.pdf">MOSD MAIN Telegram chat group</a> as late as January 2,
                only 4 days before Jan 6 (see Government Exhibit <b>507-7</b>). Thus, the connection between Tarrio and Pezzola,
                and by extension Pezzola's involvement in the alleged conspiracy, was
                somewhat tenuous.
                <br><br>
                But since <b>Pezzola</b> happened to be one of the first rioters to breach the Capitol building, the prosecution
                wanted to strengthen the connection between <b>Pezzola's</b> action and <b>Tarrio's</b> planning. The inclusion of this Telegram post
                in the indictment is meant to strengthen the link between Pezzola and Tarrio, suggesting to the jury that when Pezzola 
                smashed the window and breached the Capitol, he was carrying out Tarrio's plans. <b>Pezzola</b> was ultimately
                the only Proud Boy acquitted of the <b>seditious conspiracy</b> charge.

                        times with an individual whose identity is known to the grand jury. On December 30,2020, this
                        individual sent TARRIO a nine-page document titled, “1776 Returns.” The document set forth a
                        plan to occupy a few “crucial buildings” in Washington, D.C., on January 6, including House and
                        Senate office buildings around the Capitol, with as “many people as possible” to “show our
                        politicians We the People are in charge.” After sending the document, the individual stated, “The

                        we're, we're not going to be in colors, uh, one of the things I've been really hearing a lot about is like, oh my god, I'm hearing so much this about what's going 
                        on DC or that's going to possibly be going on in DC... Guys, look you gotta understand, we're going without colors, so, uh, a lot of, a lot of the fears and dynamics 
                        that people are thinking about are just complete bullshit and just ramble, I mean, and realistically like, I... every single rally I've done since like, like 2015, 
                        I've heard the same bullshit anyway, so I mean, it, it's, it's, it's just, it's just rumbles, and, and, and arguments.
                        <br><br>But like, um, while we're in DC and everything, I mean, it's not gonna be the same thing. We're not, we're not gonna be doing like, a Proud Bully 
                        fucking, um, you know, eight o'clock in early, uh, march, uh, and, and, and, and flexing our, flexing our guns, and shit. So you guys gotta understand that 
                        we're not doing that this time, you know, we're doing a completely different operation and there's, there's going to be a lot of uh... contingencies and, and 
                        plans laid out of what we're actually going to do and there's going to be teams, they're gonna be put together to, you know, um, you know, where they're gonna 
                        be going and what they're doing, so keep that in mind too, and like, when you tell your guys that kind of thing, um, you know, spread that word a little bit. 
                        I mean, don't, don't, don't spread it too far, but you know, spread it to the guys that you plan on bringing and everything, so that we, we can actually work 
                        together and, and, and make this make this DC event a little bit more successful.</p>
                        <br>

                        we want to make it, we want to make it, you know, successful and um, you know, we we definitely are going to run into some problems uh, maybe maybe some 
                        errors, but we want to learn from those errors and then, and then work on those errors, so that we you know we don't make those errors again in the future 
                        at the next rally, so, yeah, I just wanted to throw that out there and uh...</p>

                Next, in one of the <i><b>most misleading sections</b></i> yet, the indictment pulls two fragments from <b>Zach Rehl's</b> long-winded, rambling
                speech to the MOSD leadership during the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9HY3IVStIJc"><b>December 30, 2020 MOSD Zoom meeting</b></a> (see
                <a href="https://sigsegv1980.github.io/j6/ProudBoys-2020-12-30-MOSDZoomMeetingTranscript.pdf">full transcript</a>).
                The quoted fragments are an attempt to mislead the reader into believing that Rehl called Jan 6 a "<i>completely different operation</i>" because it
                was an operation that involved storming the Capitol.
                <br><br>
                But when read (or watched) in full, Rehl's rambling speech more or less summarizes the purpose of the <b>MOSD chapter</b>, which was
                to implement new rules and protocols that address logistical and disciplinary issues that arose during the previous D.C. rally in December. 
                These new protocols include breaking up into smaller groups (timestamp 16:59), not wearing identifying colors (timestamp 1:01:09), not getting drunk
                during rallies (4:40), and <b>always acting defensively instead of offensively</b> (timestamps 7:48, 32:03, 33:29).
                <br><br>
                These protocols were also meant to mitigate the difficulty of marching hundreds of people while maintaining formation, which was a major 
                source of frustration for Enrique Tarrio at the previous rally in December. Tarrio 
                <a href="https://sigsegv1980.github.io/j6/ProudBoys-OfficialPresidentsChat-2020-8-7_2020-12-31.pdf">compared it to herding cats</a>
                (see Government Exhibit <b>514-34</b>), because individual Proud Boys often lacked discipline while marching and broke formation after being provoked:

                Once again, the entire <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9HY3IVStIJc"><b>1 hour and 38 minute MOSD Zoom call</b></a> is
                <b>strong exculpatory evidence</b>. The Proud Boys talk for over an hour
                and a half, discussing the purpose of the <b>MOSD</b> chapter along with new rallying strategies and safety measures, but 
                <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20220626172210/https://www.nytimes.com/2022/06/26/us/politics/proud-boys-jan-6.html">never once is there any mention of
                storming the Capitol</a> or anything remotely similar. Rather, the <b>MOSD</b> chapter was created to enforce structure
                and discipline during all future national rallies (including Jan 6), with the goal of making it easier to control and direct
                large numbers of Proud Boys on the ground:

                        thing of this is, you know, <b>with a thousand Proud Boys in DC</b>, you know we were together sometimes,
                        we're all over the places sometimes, <b>but there was no way to control, you know, um there's no control

                        freedom and
                        flexibility to break off into modular elements where you can have smaller teams

                        and now you
                        have 700 guys going, you know, two blocks over, just because they see the guy next to him moving.

                        an offensive manner, but just generally speaking, so we can have that that kind of

                All of this is consistent with private discussions the Proud Boys had amongst themselves on Telegram on December 30, 2020, the same day
                as the <b>MOSD</b> Zoom call. For example,
                the following exchange in <a href="https://sigsegv1980.github.io/j6/ProudBoys-MOSD-MAIN-FullChatMessages-2020-12-27_2021-1-1.pdf"><b>MOSD MAIN</b></a>
                between <b>Johnny Blackbeard</b> and another Proud Boy again confirms
                that the purpose of the <b>MOSD</b> was to crack down on undisciplined, aggressive behavior from the rank-and-file
                Proud Boys during marches:

                As the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9HY3IVStIJc"><b>MOSD</b> Zoom call</a> was coming to an end, <b>Zach Rehl</b> 
                said he wanted to <i><b>"make this DC event a little bit more successful"</b></i> (timestamp <b>1:35:02</b>). But what does the 
                prosecution think this even means? Does it mean that Rehl thinks storming the Capitol will "<i>make this DC event a little bit more successful</i>"? 
                <b>Zach Rehl's</b> rambling speech essentially just summarizes the goal of the <b>MOSD</b> chapter, which is to improve the way the Proud Boys conduct rallies. 
                Rehl suggests this will be an iterative process that will involve some mistakes, but over time, and after multiple future rallies, the Proud Boys 
                will eventually get it right. Nothing Rehl says here suggests any seditious plans to storm the Capitol:

                Again, it's fairly obvious this entire hour and a half long Zoom call is about improving future Proud Boy rallies by
                implementing new rules and policies via the new <b>MOSD</b> chapter, and that
                Jan 6 was to be used as a test drive of these new policies. There is no hint anyone was even thinking about
                storming the Capitol at the time of the Zoom meeting on December 30th, 2020, about a week before Jan 6.

                Telegram, ominously foreshadowing the January 6 Capitol siege. In this post, a photograph shows Tarrio standing alone in front 
                of the US Capitol building. Underneath is a caption reading "<i><b>I'm home. #Soon</b></i>".<br>😨
                <br><br>
                <img src="2019TelegramPostFromMiamiProudBoys-TarrioPosingByCapitol.png"/>
                <br><br>
                Seems pretty damning, right? Except, this post wasn't included in the indictment, because 
                <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20230523110559/https://t.me/MiamiProudBoys/176">Tarrio posted this back in November of 2019</a>. Clearly,
                Tarrio had no plan to "storm the Capitol" back in 2019, because Trump hadn't even lost the election at
                that point. No prosecutor could possibly argue Tarrio had any motive to storm the Capitol back in 2019.
                But then what do we make of this ominous Telegram post?

                These Telegram posts were not included in the indictment, but they are relevant to the prosecution's argument that evidence of anti-police
                sentiment among the Proud Boys is also evidence that the Proud Boys conspired and planned in advance to attack police on Jan 6 as
                part of the plan to storm the Capitol. The prosecution also argued that Telegram and Parler posts exhibiting anti-police sentiment
                count as evidence that all the preparations the Proud Boys made prior to Jan 6, such as bringing protective
                equipment (body armor) and walkie-talkies, was for the express purpose of attacking police, and <i>not</i> for the purpose of
                fighting with <b>Antifa</b> and other counter-protesters (as the Proud Boys' defense argued).

                Once again, there is no direct evidence the Proud Boys planned to attack police in order to storm the Capitol. All we have are
                examples of the Proud Boys occasionally saying mean things on Telegram and Parler about the police. 
                <br><br>
                Historically, the Proud Boys have generally supported the police. Throughout the late 2010s as the <i>Black Lives Matter</i> movement 
                rose to prominence and police departments across the country faced significant vitriol from the public, the Proud Boys 
                remained mostly loyal to the cops, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20190712164344/https://twitter.com/FordFischer/status/1146920889096839171">proudly declaring that “Blue Lives Matter”</a>.

                seemingly cozy relationship between the Proud Boys and local police</a>.
                <br><br>
                This began to change in December of 2020, especially after a series of incidents that happened during the December 12, 2020 
                "Million MAGA March" rally in Washington DC. Firstly, four Proud Boys (including <b>Jeremy Bertino</b>) <a href="https://mpdc.dc.gov/release/arrest-made-assault-dangerous-weapon-knife-offense-500-block-11th-street-northwest">
                got stabbed during an altercation with a counter-protester</a> (whom the Proud Boys believed to be Antifa-affiliated) outside a D.C. bar. 
                <br><br>
                Secondly, Proud Boy chairman <b>Enrique Tarrio</b> decided to steal a <i>Black Lives Matter</i> banner that was hanging outside Asbury United Methodist Church, 
                an historic black church in D.C., and burn it publicly on the street. This incident was widely reported by the media and 
                <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20201213224106/https://www.nbcnews.com/news/us-news/black-lives-matter-signs-burned-d-c-churches-police-investigate-n1251050">framed by some public officials 
                and media outlets as a hate crime</a>, despite the fact that Enrique Tarrio himself is black (Afro-Cuban).
                <br><br>
                Thirdly, as the Proud Boys marched around D.C. the night of December 12, they were <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20201214213718/https://www.washingtonpost.com/local/trump-dc-rally-maga/2020/12/11/8b5af818-3bdb-11eb-bc68-96af0daae728_story.html">often obstructed by police officers</a>

                tasked with separating counter-protesters from the Proud Boys</a>. 
                When <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20201213041516/https://twitter.com/ShelbyTalcott/status/1337973625408942080">certain counter protesters</a>

                that famously wants to defund police departments because #ACAB. This explains the appearance of the derisive portmanteau <i>"coptifa"</i> among the
                Proud Boys (see also
                the <a href="https://sigsegv1980.github.io/j6/ProudBoys-OperationDCStreetSweepers-2020-12-19_2020-12-26.pdf">

                <br><br>
                The cumulative effect of all this was that some Proud Boy leaders,

                <br>
                Thus, throughout late December of 2020 and January of 2021, Proud Boys leadership became 
                <a href="https://sigsegv1980.github.io/j6/ProudBoys-RufioParlerPost-2020-12-14.pdf">somewhat antagonistic</a>
                towards the D.C. police, which explains
                the anti-police messages the Proud Boys posted on Telegram and Parler. The prosecution argues that the Proud Boys turned against the police because the Proud Boys wanted to storm the
                Capitol and therefore had to attack police. But the historical context here surrounding the Proud Boys and the
                December 12 rally <i><b>independently</b></i> explains <i>why</i> the Proud Boys suddenly turned against the police around mid-December
                of 2020.
                <br><br>
                Thus, Telegram or Parler posts from the Proud Boys that exhibit anti-police sentiment are <i>not</i> evidence of
                a plan to attack police and storm the Capitol. We know why the Proud Boys turned against the cops, and it had nothing
                to do with Jan 6.

                group (called "MOSD Members" in the Civil Suit), the Proud Boys "<i>exchanged messages about attacking the Capitol</i>".
                This is <i><b>incredibly misleading</b></i> if not outright false, because it suggests the Proud Boys were having
                a conversation <i>about</i> storming the Capitol, which implies an ongoing discussion where participants hash out the
                details of a plan to storm the Capitol. But we can look for ourselves at the discussions in the
                <a href="https://sigsegv1980.github.io/j6/ProudBoys-MOSD-Main-2020-12-27_2021-1-4.pdf"><b>MOSD MAIN Telegram group</b></a>
                on January 3, 2021 (<a href="https://sigsegv1980.github.io/j6/ProudBoys-MOSD-MAIN-FullChatMessages-2020-12-27_2021-1-1.pdf">or other days</a>),
                and see that no such discussions exist. 
                <br><br>
                The <a href="https://sigsegv1980.github.io/j6/ProudBoys-MOSD-Main-2020-12-27_2021-1-4.pdf">full context</a> 
                reveals that <b>Jake Phillips'</b> post asking about storming the Capitol was a total non-sequitur, and
                part of a discussion about a photo on social media showing the 1776 flag (an historical version of the US flag with 13 stars arranged in a circle) flying over 
                the White House (not the Capitol building). There was no discussion of any actual plans to storm the Capitol building. Also, 
                the post is from January 3, 2021, a mere <i>three days</i> before Jan 6, yet <b>Jake Phillips</b> asks about
                storming "<i>capitol buildings</i>" as if this was a new idea being raised here for the first time. Moreover, the post
                is a total non-sequitur, not part of some ongoing discussion about attacking the Capitol. Nobody
                else ever engages with Jake Phillips' post and there are no replies or follow-up posts.
                <br><br>
                More significantly, <b>Jake Phillips</b> (who is one of the only two Proud Boys ever to even bring up the idea of
                "storming the Capitol" before Jan 6) <b>wasn't even in Washington D.C. on January 6 and never even planned to go there in the first
                place</b>. Instead, <a href="https://sigsegv1980.github.io/j6/JakePhillips-MessagesFromMOSDMain.html">Jake Phillips made plans to go to Columbus, Ohio on Jan 6,</a>
                to attend a <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20210107074637/https://www.dispatch.com/story/news/local/2021/01/06/tempers-were-short-fists-flew-street-during-trump-rally/6565956002/">local protest at the 
                State Capitol building</a> with his chapter of Ohio Proud Boys. Furthermore, <b>Jake Phillips</b> didn't really approve of the idea 
                of going to Washington DC on Jan 6. He <a href="https://sigsegv1980.github.io/j6/JakePhillips-MessagesFromMOSDMain.html">argued that local State Capitol protests were more effective 
                and easier to organize than a big rally in Washington DC, and he barely participated in the planning for Jan 6</a>.
                <br><br>
                So <b>Jake Phillips</b> was not in Washington DC on Jan 6, he never had plans to go there, he was not one of the
                upper-tier MOSD leaders, and he was never arrested or charged with anything. Thus, Jake Phillips' non-sequitur remarks 
                asking about storming capitols are mostly 
                irrelevant to the seditious conspiracy case. The prosecution selectively quoted <b>Jake Phillips</b>' Telegram post to create the illusion that
                his remarks were part of an ongoing discussion specifically <i>about</i> working out a plan to storm the Capitol. But no
                such discussion exists in any of the Telegram chat groups.

                This was included in the indictment because it's one of only a handful of instances, out of thousands of Telegram and Parler posts
                recovered by the FBI, where any Proud Boy actually says the words "storm the Capitol" (or any similar phrase) prior to
                January 6th. This paragraph of the indictment is <i><b>incredibly misleading</b></i> because it presents a quote
                from Proud Boy <b>Jake Phillips</b>, leader of the Ohio Proud Boys, without any context, and claims the quote is part of a conversation where
                the Proud Boys "<i>exchanged messages in the MOSD Members Group various statements about attacking the Capitol</i>".
                This misleads the jury to believe that <b>Jake Phillips'</b> post was part of
                an ongoing discussion that was actually <i>about</i> hashing out the details of a plan to attack the Capitol building.
                <br><br>
                But when we read the post in context, we immediately see that no such discussion exists. The actual topic of
                discussion is the <i>certification of Pennsylvania's electoral votes</i>, brought up originally by <b>Kbsman2</b>.
                The post from <b>Jake Phillips</b>, rhetorically asking about storming the Capitol, is a complete <i>non-sequitur</i>.
                It is not part of any ongoing discussion about storming the Capitol, and there are no further follow-up posts
                after <b>Johnny Blackbeard's</b> terse reply. 
                <br><br>
                Moreover, this exchange took place on January 4, 2021, merely <i>two days</i>
                before Jan 6. Yet <b>Jake Phillips</b> rhetorically asks about storming the Capitol as if this were a novel idea
                brought up here for the first time. If the the prosecution's seditious conspiracy case holds weight, the Proud Boys
                should have been finalizing the details of their plan to storm the Capitol by this point, and discussions about
                storming the Capitol should have dominated the <b>MOSD</b> Telegram chat groups. Instead, all we have
                are a handful of non-sequitur comments like this one, out of thousands of Telegram posts.
                <br><br>
                Even more significantly, this conversation involves three Proud Boys - <b>Kbsman2</b>, <b>Jake Phillips</b>, and <b>Johnny Blackbeard</b>, 
                <b><i>none of whom were even present in Washington D.C. on January 6th.</i></b> Jake Phillips, who first brought up the idea of storming 
                the “capital building”, <a href="https://sigsegv1980.github.io/j6/JakePhillips-MessagesFromMOSDMain.html">
                never even planned on going to D.C. for January 6th</a> and was largely uninvolved in planning for the event. 
                Instead, <b>Jake Phillips</b> and the Ohio Proud Boys went to <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20210107074637/https://www.dispatch.com/story/news/local/2021/01/06/tempers-were-short-fists-flew-street-during-trump-rally/6565956002/">
                protest in Columbus, Ohio on January 6th</a>. Similarly, <b>Kbsman2</b> and 
                <b>Johnny Blackbeard</b> were Pennsylvania Proud Boys who never showed up in D.C. on Jan 6 either. <b>Johnny Blackbeard</b> essentially 
                <a href="https://lancasteronline.com/news/politics/carlisle-proud-boy-member-targeted-in-search-warrant-tied-to-jan-6-plot/article_c2596928-a258-11ec-a6bb-c79ff2e0e8a7.html">called out sick due to a hernia</a>.
                <br><br>
                Moreover, of the three Proud Boys involved in this brief conversation, only <b>Johnny Blackbeard</b> was an upper-tier leader with any real authority in the MOSD chapter, 
                and the <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/dc-md-va/2022/10/28/proud-boys-jan6-stewart-tarrio/">only one actually arrested and charged with anything</a>, 
                despite not even being present in D.C. on January 6th. Yet it was <b>Jake Phillips</b> — not Johnny Blackbeard — 
                who first brought up the idea of storming the Capitol. But <b>Jake Phillips</b> wasn’t in DC on January 6 either and was never arrested or implicated in the conspiracy. 
                <b>Jake Phillips</b> didn't even really approve of the Jan 6 rally in D.C. and was barely involved in planning it,
                <a href="https://sigsegv1980.github.io/j6/JakePhillips-MessagesFromMOSDMain.html">
                arguing that smaller State Capitol protests are easier to organize and more effective than a single large rally</a>. 
                But if <b>Jake Phillips’</b> Telegram post about storming the Capitol is supposed to be compelling evidence of a pre-planned seditious conspiracy, why was Jake 
                Phillips himself never arrested or charged?
                <br><br>
                Finally, it's entirely possible that <b>Jake Phillips</b> wasn't even referring to the US Capitol building here. At the time of these posts in early January of 2021, 
                the <b>"Stop the Steal"</b> movement was ongoing, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20201231183223/https://stopthesteal.us/">
                holding rallies and protests</a> at

                These <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20201230141335/https://parler.com/profile/Redcode71/posts">
                <b>State Capitol</b> protests continued to take place through January 6</a>. To put things in perspective, between November of 2020 and January 5th, 2021, there were
                <a href="https://sigsegv1980.github.io/j6/ZenodoParlerPostsFromNovember2020ToJanuary2021WithKeywordStormTheCapitol_IncludingEchoes.html">
                <b>468 Parler posts that exhorted Trump supporters to "storm the Capitol"</b></a> (or some variation of that phrase). 
                Over half of these Parler posts were <a href="https://sigsegv1980.github.io/j6/ZenodoParlerPostsFromNovember2020ToJanuary2021_StormingStateCapitols_IncludingEchoes.html">
                actually referring to <i><B>State Capitol buildings</b></i>.</a> Similarly, across all of 
                <b>Jake Phillips’</b> Telegram posts in <a href="https://sigsegv1980.github.io/j6/JakePhillips-MessagesFromMOSDMain.html">MOSD MAIN</a>, 
                he uses the word “capital/capitol” 7 times, and 
                <a href="https://sigsegv1980.github.io/j6/JakePhillips-MessagesFromMOSDMainMentioningCapitol.html">5 out of 7 times he is clearly and 
                unambiguously talking about <b>State Capitol</b> buildings</a>. Jake Phillips also stated explicitly that he 
                <a href="https://sigsegv1980.github.io/j6/JakePhillips-MessagesFromMOSDMain.html">prefers <b>State Capitol</b>
                protests</a> over rallying in Washington DC.
                <br><br>
                Thus, given that <b>Jake Phillips'</b> post about storming the Capitol was in reply to
                an earlier post from <b>Kbsman2</b> talking about Pennsylvania's electoral votes, it's quite plausible and even likely that <b>Jake Phillips</b>
                — who was <a href="https://sigsegv1980.github.io/j6/JakePhillips-MessagesFromMOSDMainMentioningCapitol.html">all about <b>State Capitol</b> rallies</a> — was 
                actually referring to the <b>Pennsylvania Capitol building in Harrisburg</b>. And as it turns out, a contingent of Pennsylvania Proud Boys showed up

                Included in the indictment because one Proud Boy, <b>John Charles Stewart (Johnny Blackbeard)</b>, mentions
                the Capitol building and recommends planning "<i>the operations base around the front entrance of the Capitol
                building</i>" and also recommends using the National Mall, because <i>"it's a wide open space, you can see
                everything coming from all angles."</i> This suggests to the jury that <b>Johnny Blackbeard's</b> comment is part of 
                a conversation where the Proud Boys were hashing out the logistical details of their plan to storm the Capitol
                building. Again, the prosecution relies on the jury's natural <i>confirmation bias</i> to interpret any mention
                of the Capitol building or planning in general as evidence of a seditious conspiracy to storm the Capitol.
                <br><br>
                However, the full context reveals the Proud Boys were simply talking about <i>event planning</i>. <b>Johnny Blackbeard</b>'s
                statement about the Capitol building was in response to <b>Enrique Tarrio's</b> post, where he says <i>"I'm getting so many 
                conflicting issues with, like, stages, locations, and times that, um, that I don't know where to put people."</i> But why is
                Tarrio concerned with <i>"like, stages locations, and times"</i>? The reason Tarrio is concerned about these things is
                because the Proud Boys planned to attend the <a href="https://sigsegv1980.github.io/j6/Jan6MAGARallyMapGuideFull.pdf"><b>official events on Jan 6</b></a>, 
                because some Proud Boys were working
                security for these events, and <b>Enrique Tarrio</b> was very likely booked as a guest speaker on Jan 6 at the 
                <a href="https://sigsegv1980.github.io/j6/LatinosForTrumpJan6Flyer.pdf"><b>“Latinos for Trump” stage</b></a>
                at “Area 7” (300 First Street NE) by the Capitol between 10 AM and 12 PM. This is why <b>Zach Rehl</b> asks <i>"Is
                [Enrique Tarrio] still doing a speech? Where is that?"</i>
                <br><br>
                The Proud Boys often <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20201115132417/https://weartv.com/news/local/proud-boys-provide-security-at-pro-america-rally-in-milton">

                <b>Enrique Tarrio</b> also complained about "<i>conflicting issues</i>" with <i>"like, stages, locations, and times"</i>. Tarrio was getting "<i>conflicting

                <b>Enrique Tarrio</b> was very likely scheduled to give a speech on Jan 6 at the <b>"Latinos for Trump"</b> stage near the Capitol building at “Area 7” (300 First Street NE) 
                between 10 AM and 12 PM. (See

                plus Zach Rehl asking about Tarrio's speech. Tarrio was 
                <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20201002154105/https://www.nytimes.com/2020/10/02/us/elections/the-florida-director-of-a-pro-trump-latino-group-is-the-chairman-of-the-proud-boys.html">
                Florida State director</a> of Latinos for Trump.)
                <br><br>
                Thus, since multiple Proud Boys, including <b>George "Asher" Mesa</b> and some Proud Boys from Tarrio's
                chapter, were scheduled to work security at the "Latinos for Trump" stage by the US Capitol on Jan 6, and Tarrio himself would
                likely be giving a speech there, <b>Johnny Blackbeard</b> recommended
                establishing "<i>the operations base</i>" by the Capitol building on the National Mall side. Obviously, the "<i>wide open space, [where] you can see everything 
                coming from all angles</i>" would make it easier for security personnel to detect threats from counter-protesters and secure the area around the stage.
                <br><br>
                Finally, <b>Johnny Blackbeard</b> was also worried about the DC Metropolitan Police potentially arresting Proud Boys on site, because of the
                <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20201213224106/https://www.nbcnews.com/news/us-news/black-lives-matter-signs-burned-d-c-churches-police-investigate-n1251050">

                Once again, the context surrounding these allegedly incriminating Telegram posts reveals that they have nothing to do with
                any seditious plan to storm the Capitol. They're about basic event planning.

                This Telegram post is one of the most important pieces of evidence for the prosecution's case.
                <b>Enrique Tarrio</b>, chairman of the Proud Boys, actually says the words "storm the Capitol". This is one of only a handful of instances, across thousands of
                Telegram and Parler posts recovered by the FBI, where any Proud Boy actually says the words "storm the Capitol" (or any similar
                phrase), prior to January 6.
                <br><br>
                Except once again, this does not demonstrate any actual plan to storm the Capitol. It's a complete non-sequitur, and there are no replies
                or follow-up discussion that we know about. Furthermore, <b>Enrique Tarrio</b> posted this on <i>January 4th</i>, a mere <i>two days</i> before Jan 6.
                If the prosecution's <b>seditious conspiracy</b> case had any merit, any plans to storm the Capitol should have been nearly finalized by January 4th, and should 
                have dominated the discussions in the <b>MOSD</b> Telegram group. Instead, all we have are a handful of isolated, non-sequitur comments like this, 
                with no specific details.
                <br><br>
                It's possible Tarrio was simply joking. It's also possible Tarrio was actually seriously considering trying to storm the Capitol.
                He certainly approved and celebrated when hundreds of Trump supporters breached the Capitol on
                January 6. But again, there's simply no evidence that the Proud Boys actually <i>made plans in advance of Jan 6</i> to storm the Capitol. In 
                <b>Enrique Tarrio's</b> voice message (<a href="TarrioSayingYouWantToStormTheCapitol.mp4">listen for yourself</a>), 
                he says <i>"you want to storm the Capitol"</i> with a rising-falling intonation that suggests mild surprise or amusement.
                <br><br>
                But why would Tarrio joke about storming the Capitol, or even bring up such an idea, if the Proud Boys weren't already planning
                on storming the Capitol, or at least considering such a plan? Well, <b>Enrique Tarrio</b> doesn't exist in a vacuum. The idea of 
                "storming the Capitol" was very popular with the online MAGA-sphere at the time. From November 2020 through January 5, 2021, there
                were around <a href="https://sigsegv1980.github.io/j6/ZenodoParlerPostsFromNovember2020ToJanuary2021WithKeywordStormTheCapitol_IncludingEchoes.html">
                <b>468 Parler posts</b> (including echoes) exhorting Trump supporters to <b>storm Capitol buildings</b></a> or other administrative centers, 
                averaging around <b>40,943</b> daily views. This includes calls to storm both State Capitol buildings and the US Capitol building
                in DC. 
                <br><br>
                In fact, "storming the Capitol building" doesn't even necessarily refer to an illegal act. It can sometimes
                mean something like "occupy the Capitol". In November, 2020, in Atlanta, Georgia, Alex Jones <i><b>legally</b></i> led a contingent 
                of Trump supporters inside the Georgia State Capitol building, where they stood around with signs and chanted slogans before leaving 
                peacefully. Yet <i>The Gateway Pundit</i>, a conservative news outlet, reported that Jones led a 
                <a href="https://www.thegatewaypundit.com/2020/11/happening-now-alex-jones-leading-crowd-trump-supporters-storming-georgia-state-capitol-video/">
                “<i><b>Crowd of Trump Supporters Storming [the] Georgia State Capitol</b></i>”</a>.
                Some journalists on Twitter also referred to this completely legal demonstration as 
                <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20201118174048/https://twitter.com/BGOnTheScene/status/1329116419037024273">"<b><i>storm[ing] the Capitol</i></b>"</a> as well.
                <br><br>
                Clearly, the phrase "storm the Capitol" was sometimes used in the sense of "occupy the Capitol", i.e. a form of
                legitimate political protest. The phrase "occupy the Capitol", or some variation of it, appeared
                <a href="https://sigsegv1980.github.io/j6/ParlerPostsUsingOccupyLikeProgressives_2020_IncludingEchoes.html">on Parler around <b>3,450</b>
                times</a> from November 2020 through January 5, 2021. The concept of "storming" or "occupying" Capitol buildings was simply
                a prevalent feature of the zeitgeist surrounding the "Stop the Steal" or MAGA movement in late 2020. 
                <br><br>
                But even if Tarrio wasn't joking, there's no evidence the Proud Boys devised any formal plans to storm the Capitol. In fact, there's
                actually direct evidence to the contrary. On January 2, 2021, just 2 days before Tarrio posted this voice message on Telegram, Tarrio posted 
                <a href="https://sigsegv1980.github.io/j6/ProudBoys-MOSDChat-2020-12-20_2021-1-4.pdf">another voice message
                in the MOSD chat (Government Exhibit 501-53)</a>, in response to a Tweet someone posted accusing the Proud Boys of 
                planning to break into Federal buildings on January 6th. <b>Enrique Tarrio</b>
                then began posting jokes about this, including a self-deprecating joke lamenting that the Proud Boys could <i>barely</i> even march in formation 
                correctly, and were therefore not even remotely capable of doing something as cool as storming a Federal building:

                <a href="https://www.vice.com/en/article/enrique-tarrio-proud-boys-jury/">strong evidence of guilt</a>, and 
                likely a large part of the reason the jury found most of the
                Proud Boys on trial guilty of <b>seditious conspiracy</b>. Of course, the complete lack of any direct evidence of 
                advance planning to storm the Capitol should have been sufficient for a "not guilty" verdict due to reasonable doubt. 
                Nonetheless, it's certainly fair to ask: if the Proud Boys
                really <i>didn't</i> make plans prior to Jan 6 to storm the Capitol, then <b><i>why</i></b> did they act as if they
                had something to hide by possibly deleting messages and fretting about the cops finding their Telegram chats? 
                If the Proud Boys merely planned on coming to D.C., marching around
                as they usually do, attending the <a href="https://sigsegv1980.github.io/j6/Jan6MAGARallyMapGuideFull.pdf"><b>official events</b></a> 
                and working security details, then what exactly were they afraid of? Why was <b>Charles Donohoe</b> so
                concerned about the cops finding out about their "boots on ground" plans?
                <br><br>
                It's likely that the Proud Boys didn't actually delete many messages from the <b>MOSD</b> group chat, if they deleted any. 
                <b>Aaron Wolkin</b> expressed the opinion (excluded from the indictment) that deleting messages was a <i>"waste of time"</i>,
                and that (according to Wolkin) <i>"Google and apple key log everything that you type into your phone anyways"</i>.
                <b>Zach Rehl</b> added that permanently erasing Telegram messages from the server is a cumbersome process. Regardless, even 
                if the Proud Boys were too lazy to
                actually delete all messages in <b>MOSD</b>, they were still clearly distressed over the possibility that 
                law enforcement would read their private Telegram messages after confiscating <b>Enrique Tarrio</b>'s phone.
                <br><br>
                This is best explained by the fact that the Proud Boys leadership had a strong 
                <a href="https://sigsegv1980.github.io/j6/ProudBoys-MOSDProspectsSmall.pdf">OPSEC (operational security) ethos</a>,
                and there are numerous reasons why the Proud Boys would want to prevent their private chats from falling into the hands of
                law enforcement aside from any secret plans to storm the US Capitol. While the Proud Boys' actual plan for
                the daylight portion of January 6 mostly involved <i><b>legal</b></i> activities like attending 
                <a href="https://sigsegv1980.github.io/j6/Jan6MAGARallyMapGuideFull.pdf"><b>the official events</b></a>, giving speeches,
                working security details, and <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20201212181701/https://twitter.com/ShelbyTalcott/status/1337823451327946755">
                marching around</a> the streets of D.C. <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20201114160836/https://video.parler.com/4v/ga/4vga86G6g0Pq.mp4">chanting slogans</a>, they also discussed
                more <b>legally dubious</b> activities for their evening plans, which usually involved getting

                The Proud Boys
                use the umbrella term <b>"Antifa"</b> to refer to various regional <i>anti-fascist</i> or anarchist

                The Proud Boys sometimes used the phrase <b>"in minecraft"</b> or <b>"playing minecraft"</b> as a euphemism for doing something violent or illegal. They often used this phrase

                Capitol building is <a href="https://sigsegv1980.github.io/j6/ProudBoys-ExportedTelegramChatMOSDOp/messages.html#go_to_message546">mentioned only once</a>, 
                when somebody brings up the Hyatt Hotel near the Capitol building.) The discussion
                is focused almost entirely on <a href="https://sigsegv1980.github.io/j6/ProudBoys-ExportedTelegramChatMOSDOp/messages.html#go_to_message502">combat strategies</a>,
                <a href="https://sigsegv1980.github.io/j6/ProudBoys-ExportedTelegramChatMOSDOp/messages.html#go_to_message532">weapons</a>,

                <br><br>
                Secondly, these discussions make it abundantly clear <i>why</i> the Proud Boys would <i>not</i> want law enforcement
                getting hold of their Telegram chats. The Proud Boys discuss many illegal or border-line illegal activities, such as 
                <a href="https://sigsegv1980.github.io/j6/ProudBoys-ExportedTelegramChatMOSDOp/messages.html#go_to_message532">bringing
                legally prohibited knives into Washington D.C.</a>, using

                using a <a href="https://sigsegv1980.github.io/j6/ProudBoys-ExportedTelegramChatMOSDOp/messages.html#go_to_message500">"mini-flamethrower"</a>,
                as well as various comments about <a href="https://sigsegv1980.github.io/j6/ProudBoys-ExportedTelegramChatMOSDOp/messages.html#go_to_message489">knocking out or otherwise assaulting</a> 
                <b>Antifa</b> members. On top of this, the group chat
                is filled with <a href="https://sigsegv1980.github.io/j6/ProudBoys-ExportedTelegramChatMOSDOp/messages.html#go_to_message292">offensive jokes and memes</a>, 
                <a href="https://sigsegv1980.github.io/j6/ProudBoys-ExportedTelegramChatMOSDOp/messages.html#go_to_message8">slurs</a>, 
                and some posts <a href="https://sigsegv1980.github.io/j6/ProudBoys-ExportedTelegramChatMOSDOp/messages.html#go_to_message600">glorifying violence</a> with various degrees of
                sincerity. All of this suggests some pretty compelling reasons for the Proud Boys to want to keep
                their private Telegram chats away from the prying eyes of law enforcement.
                <br><br>
                If that isn't enough of a reason, the Proud Boys also became very <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20201214213718/https://www.washingtonpost.com/local/trump-dc-rally-maga/2020/12/11/8b5af818-3bdb-11eb-bc68-96af0daae728_story.html">

                Proud Boy <b>John Charles Stewart</b> (a.k.a. <b>Johnny Blackbeard</b>) was paranoid that D.C. Metro police officers may try to 
                ambush individual Proud Boys in D.C. <i>"from a fucking side street"</i> and arrest them on site</a>.
                The <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20220712213106/https://twitter.com/maustermuhle/status/1346521554855874565">arrest of <b>Enrique Tarrio</b></a> on 
                January 4th by the D.C. Metro Police only <a href="https://sigsegv1980.github.io/j6/ProudBoys-RufioParlerPost-2020-12-14.pdf">further intensified</a>
                the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20210110204254/https://rumble.com/vcbz9d-rebel-talk-episode-2.html">Proud Boys' paranoia and animosity towards law enforcement</a>.
                It is therefore quite easy to understand why the Proud Boys would want to prevent
                law enforcement from reading their private Telegram chats, regardless of whether the Proud Boys actually had any secret plans
                to storm the Capitol or not.

                Included in the indictment to ensure the jury is aware that Proud Boy and MOSD leader <b>Charles Donohoe</b> said <i>"we can be looking at Gang charges"</i>
                after <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20220712213106/https://twitter.com/maustermuhle/status/1346521554855874565">
                <b>Enrique Tarrio</b> was arrested</a> in D.C. on January 4, 2021. The jury
                is encouraged to interpret Donohoe's statement as a damning admission that the Proud Boys were involved in
                a <b>seditious conspiracy</b> to storm the Capitol. The prosecution wants the jury to equate whatever Donohoe 
                meant by <i>"gang charges"</i> with the <b>seditious conspiracy</b> charges.
                <br><br>
                Some of the context surrounding Donohoe's statement is likely missing from the available Telegram extractions. However,
                there is enough context to make it clear that the topic of discussion was Proud Boy Chairman
                <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20220712213106/https://twitter.com/maustermuhle/status/1346521554855874565"><b>Enrique Tarrio</b>'s arrest 
                </a>after arriving in D.C. on January 4, 2021. The Proud Boys were concerned that the
                D.C. police would confiscate Tarrio's phone and gain access to private Telegram
                group chats like <b>MOSD</b>. To prevent this from happening, <b>Charles Donohoe</b>,
                with help from other Proud Boys, led a mass exodus from the MOSD Telegram chat groups (including 
                <a href="https://sigsegv1980.github.io/j6/ProudBoys-MOSDChat-2020-12-20_2021-1-4.pdf"><b>MOSD</b></a>,

                and created new replacement chat groups such as

                Once again, the prosecution suggests to the jury that the <i>only</i> possible reason the Proud Boys
                would try to conceal their Telegram conversations from authorities is because the Proud Boys were
                secretly planning to storm the Capitol on January 6. But there is no evidence the Proud Boys made
                any such plans in advance of Jan 6, and there are numerous <i>other</i> reasons the Proud Boys
                had to conceal their Telegram conversations from authorities. The Proud Boys did not
                conspire in advance to storm the Capitol, but they certainly planned on doing various illegal or border-line
                illegal things in Washington D.C. that they regularly discussed on Telegram. This includes
                <a href="https://sigsegv1980.github.io/j6/ProudBoys-ExportedTelegramChatMOSDOp/messages.html#go_to_message532">
                discussions about illegally bringing prohibited knives</a> into Washington D.C., as well as various

                a previous rally</a> (see Johnny Blackbeard's post on 12/30/2020 at 7:13 PM). There were many such discussions on Telegram about doing things <i>"in minecraft"</i>. It's just
                that none of these illicit activities done <i>"in minecraft"</i> had anything to do with storming the Capitol.

                Included in the indictment because it establishes that the Proud Boys had some form of a plan on Jan 6, and
                they used hand-held radios (<a href="https://www.baofengradio.com/">Baofeng radios</a>) to coordinate. The prosecution
                suggests to the jury that any evidence of planning, including the use of communication equipment, is also evidence
                of a secret conspiracy to storm the Capitol planned in advance of Jan 6. 
                (See paragraph 28 of <a href="https://sigsegv1980.github.io/j6/2022-06-06-USAvEthanNordeanAndJosephBiggsAndZacharyRehlAndEnriqueTarrioAndDominicPezzola-ThirdSupersedingIndictment.pdf">the indictment</a>.)
                <br><br>
                Again, the prosecution's argument that <i>any</i> evidence of planning in general is also <i>specifically</i> evidence 
                of a pre-planned <b>seditious conspiracy</b> to storm the Capitol is completely fallacious. The Proud Boys regularly made plans
                and used communication equipment at previous rallies. These plans generally took the form of an itinerary
                for the day before the rally, including a pre-rally security brief, and an itinerary for
                the day of rally itself, which included rules for interacting with the public and recruiting new members, 
                an itinerary for a day-time march through the streets,
                and sometimes a night march as well.
                <br><br>
                When the Proud Boys mentioned their "plans" for Jan 6 on Telegram, <i>these</i> mundane itineraries
                are the sort of plans they were referring to. For an example of an <b>ACTUAL</b> Proud Boy plan/itinerary for a rally

                Note the similarities between this plan/itinerary for the December 12 rally and what little we know of the Jan 6 rally plan. 
                Firstly, most of the same people involved with planning the December 12 rally later went on
                to join the <b>MOSD</b> chapter where they would help plan for Jan 6. Both rallies also involved
                a day-time march through Washington DC. During the planning for both rallies, <b>Enrique Tarrio</b> emphasized
                rules for interacting with the public and rules about wearing
                official club colors. Notably, in the above-quoted plans for December 12, <b>Enrique Tarrio</b> issued strict rules addressing behavior and discipline,
                ordering the Proud Boys to follow the itinerary and stay together, to always act <i>"IN SELF DEFENSE"</i>, 
                and not to speak to the media but also not to actively prevent the media from doing their job. This is all
                very similar to the topics discussed during the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9HY3IVStIJc">MOSD Zoom meeting</a> 
                (see <a href="https://sigsegv1980.github.io/j6/ProudBoys-2020-12-30-MOSDZoomMeetingTranscript.pdf">full transcript</a>) a week before the January 6 rally. It's obvious
                that seeds of the <b>Ministry of Self Defense (MOSD)</b> chapter were already forming in Tarrio's mind even before the December 12 rally,
                as Tarrio already seemed frustrated over behavioral/disciplinary issues, prompting Tarrio to emphasize the need to stay together and
                act defensively, even before the <b>MOSD</b> chapter existed.
                <br><br>
                At the same time, we know that the Proud Boys expected the Jan 6 rally to be significantly different from previous rallies
                in certain ways. The prosecution has highlighted statements from the Proud Boys' that emphasize the special uniqueness of the 
                Jan 6 rally compared with previous rallies, in order to lead the jury to conclude that the Proud Boys had secret plans
                to attack the Capitol on Jan 6. But <b>Enrique Tarrio</b> clearly explained the <i>true objective</i> of the Jan 6 rally: to
                hold a trial run of the new <B>MOSD</b> protocols. Basically, Tarrio wanted to use the Jan 6 rally as an opporunity
                to <b>test drive the new MOSD chapter</b> by trying to navigate the streets 
                of D.C. as a cohesive, disciplined, well-oiled infantry, organized into 10 man squads orbiting a single "nucleus":

                Again, all this is consistent with <b>Enrique Tarrio's</b> announcement posted on December 29, 2020, in the 
                <a href="https://sigsegv1980.github.io/j6/ProudBoys-MOSD-MAIN-FullChatMessages-2020-12-27_2021-1-1.pdf"><b>MOSD MAIN</b> Telegram group</a>, where he said 
                <i>"we are going to be <b>using the 6th as a test</b> [of the new MOSD policies]"</i>.
                <br><br>
                Thus, the Proud Boys' objective for Jan 6 is no mystery. <b>Enrique Tarrio</b> directly explained the objective during the 
                <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9HY3IVStIJc"><b>MOSD Zoom call on December 30, 2020</b></a>

                nothing to do with any <b>seditious conspiracy</b> to attack the Capitol.
                <br><br>
                However, while the Proud Boys' overall objective for January 6 is clear, an exact
                itinerary for the January 6 rally that includes things like precise marching routes (similar to 
                the <a href="https://sigsegv1980.github.io/j6/ProudBoys-EastCoastRallyCommandChat.pdf"><b>itinerary for the December 12th rally</b></a>
                posted above) was never posted on Telegram (or at least not included among the Telegram exhibits). This is most likely
                because <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20220712213106/https://twitter.com/maustermuhle/status/1346521554855874565">
                <b>Enrique Tarrio was arrested</b> on January 4th, 2021</a>, throwing the Proud Boys' pre-rally planning

                <b>Johnny Blackbeard</b> posted a message in the <b>New MOSD</b> Telegram group</a> (Govt Exhibit <b>509-30</b>), addressing the

                It's clear that many groups of Proud Boys felt there was no leadership or direction, and decided to
                act autonomously, going off to march on their own. Additionally, one Proud Boy 
                felt that <b>the plans for Jan 6 were basically <i>"a mirror"</i> of the plan for December 12</b>. The plan for December 12,
                quoted above in full, was basically just to march to and from Freedom Plaza.
                <br><br>
                It's clear that while the <b>MOSD</b> leaders probably came up with some itinerary or plan for Jan 6, most likely
                involving one or more marches around D.C. just like the previous D.C. rally on December 12, the details of this
                plan were very poorly communicated. As late as <b>11:12 AM</b> on January 6, less than <i>two hours</i> before hundreds of
                Trump supporters began storming the US Capitol building, the <b>MOSD</b> leadership was <i>still</i>

                This conversation occurred less than <i>two hours</i> before Trump supporters began storming the

                of leadership, while <b>Zach Rehl</b>, a <b>MOSD</b> leader who was found guilty of <b><i>seditious conspiracy</i></b>,
                is off <i>"doing our thing"</i> with his chapter of Proud Boys on the ground in DC. It strains credulity to believe these

                Included in the indictment because <b>Joe Biggs'</b> Telegram post mentioning <i>"tomorrow's plan"</i> establishes that the Proud Boys

                Telegram evidence shows that the <b>MOSD</b> leadership came up with <i>some</i> kind of plan or itinerary for January 6 (likely

                Included in the indictment because <b>Joe Biggs</b> said <i>"tomorrow's the day"</i> on January 5th, 2021, suggesting

                big plans are mentioned. The prosecution
                relied on natural <b>confirmation bias</b> to lead the jury to interpret <i>any</i> mention

                last minute and very poorly communicated — both to the rank-and-file Proud Boys and among the leadership. 
                <b>Joe Biggs</b> hinted at some sort of plan for tomorrow (Jan 6) after one of the rank-and-file Proud Boys
                complained there was <i>"no fuckin plan either"</i>. Yet no specific details of this plan were ever divulged (at least not on Telegram), and 
                later that evening and on the day of January 6 itself as
                late as <b>12:00 noon</b> (less than <i>one hour</i> before the <b>insurrection</b> began), members of the <b>MOSD</b> leadership were
                <i>still</i> asking basic questions about "the plan" (see Govt Exhibits <b>509-23</b> and <b>509-29</b>

                This is included in the indictment simply to remind the jury that Proud Boy <b>Dominic Pezzola</b> was
                a member of the <b>MOSD</b> chapter. The prosecution believed it was important to emphasize this,
                because they also claimed that <b>Dominic Pezzola</b>
                was the <i>first</i> rioter on January 6th to physically breach the US Capitol building, allowing the 
                mob of angry Trump supporters to enter the building.
                <br><br>
                <b>Dominic Pezzola</b>'s defense admitted that he smashed a window using a riot shield,
                but <a href="2023-08-06-USAvDominicPezzola-DefendantPezzolasReplyToUnitedStatesResponseToPezzolaRule29and33Motions.pdf">
                denied that Pezzola was the first person to actually breach the Capitol building</a> on Jan 6, claiming that an unidentified individual wearing a red cap, 
                glasses and a red sweater first shattered the window. (The truth is a bit complicated and perhaps open to interpretation: see 
                the <a href="#anc16">above analysis of <b>paragraph 39 of the indictment</b></a>.)
                <br><br>
                <b>Dominic Pezzola</b> was a rank-and-file Proud Boy, not a member of <b>MOSD</b> leadership with any real authority
                in the <b>MOSD</b> chapter. Pezzola joined the Proud Boys less than <i>two months</i> before 
                Jan 6 (see <a href="https://sigsegv1980.github.io/j6/j6/2023-04-05-USAvProudBoys-TranscriptOfJuryTrial-Day60.pdf">trial testimony of Lisa Magee</a>).
                Pezzola was not a member of the <b>MOSD</b> leadership chat group, and only joined 
                <a href="https://sigsegv1980.github.io/j6/ProudBoys-MOSD-Main-2020-12-27_2021-1-4.pdf"><b>MOSD MAIN</b></a> — the Telegram chat group
                for rank-and-file Proud Boys — on the evening of January 2nd, a mere <i>four days</i> before January 6th (see Government Exhibit <b>507-7</b>).
                Furthermore, <b>Dominic Pezzola</b> ("Spazzo - 2nd°" on Telegram) barely posted anything significant at all on Telegram. Only <i>three</i> posts from 
                Pezzola appear among the 
                <a href="https://sigsegv1980.github.io/j6/ProudBoys-MOSD-Main-2020-12-27_2021-1-4.pdf"><b>MOSD MAIN</b></a> Exhibits (see <b>Govt Exhibit 507-7</b>), and all three
                are basically just hellos and greetings. In the <a href="https://sigsegv1980.github.io/j6/ProudBoys-BootsOnTheGroundChat.pdf"><b>Boots on the Ground</b> Telegram chat group</a>
                (see Govt Exhibit <b>512-3</b>), 
                quoted here in paragraph 59 of the indictment,
                Pezzola only posted <i>twice</i> (at least among the available exhibits): once to say <i>“Anybody need coms programmed hit me up”</i> and another
                time to say <i>“Just arrived”</i>.
                
                <br><br>
                If it weren't for the fact that <b>Dominic Pezzola</b> <i>happened</i> to be one of the first rioters to breach the Capitol building on
                January 6th, the prosecution likely would not have even bothered to include him in the indictment. Ultimately, Pezzola was
                the only Proud Boy acquitted of the <b>seditious conspiracy</b> charge.

                Included in the indictment because it establishes that the Proud Boys had some sort of plan
                on January 6th, and that one component of this plan involved meeting at the Washington Monument
                at 10 AM on the morning of January 6, without dressing in official black and orange Proud Boy 
                club colors. This paragraph of the indictment is one of several paragraphs that selectively
                quotes from the relevant Proud Boy Telegram messages to suggest that the Proud Boys had some
                secret, detailed plan to storm the Capitol.
                <br><br>
                But the full context reveals firstly that no actual details of this "plan" were ever divulged
                over Telegram, beyond the initial meeting place at the Washington Monument. Certainly, nothing
                about any plans to storm the Capitol were ever mentioned. Secondly, the full context reveals
                a much greater level of uncertainty, indecision, confused leadership, and a general lack of clarity surrounding 
                "the plan". 
                <br><br>
                After <b>Enrique Tarrio</b> was arrested on January 4, whatever plans for Jan 6 the <b>MOSD</b>
                leadership had devised fell into disarray. On the evening of January 4, some rank-and-file Proud 
                Boys in the <b>MOSD</b> chapter
                turned to <b>Joe Biggs</b> and <b>Jeremy Bertino</b>

                It's clear that at this point, the rank-and-file Proud Boys in the <b>MOSD</b> chapter had no idea about
                any specific plans for Jan 6. But what about the senior <b>MOSD</b> leaders like <b>Joe Biggs</b>, <b>Jeremy Bertino</b>, 
                <b>Aaron Wolkind</b> or <b>Charles Donohoe</b>? Even senior leadership was not exactly on the same page
                about the plan for Jan 6. During the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9HY3IVStIJc"><b>December 30th, 2020 MOSD Zoom call</b></a>
                (see <a href="https://sigsegv1980.github.io/j6/ProudBoys-2020-12-30-MOSDZoomMeetingTranscript.pdf">full transcript</a>), 
                <b>Enrique Tarrio</b> and the <b>MOSD</b> leadership explained that the objective for January 6
                was to "test drive" the new <b>MOSD</b> command structure (see timestamp <b>17:35</b>), which entailed breaking up into 10 man teams while in D.C. 
                in order to make it easier for leadership to command larger numbers of rank-and-file Proud Boys as a cohesive
                infantry.
                <br><br>
                But on the morning 
                of January 5th, there seemed to be
                significant confusion 
                among senior <b>MOSD</b> leadership over the issue of <a href="https://sigsegv1980.github.io/j6/ProudBoys-NewMOSD-2021-1-4_2021-1-13.pdf">
                <b>breaking up into teams</b></a> (see Govt Exhibit <b>509-15</b>).
                <b>Joe Biggs</b> seemed to have no clue what was going on in
                terms of breaking up into teams, while <b>Johnny Blackbeard</b> lamented that <i>"our plan 
                has totally broken down"</i>. Yet <b>Jeremy Bertino</b> dismissed the idea of teams entirely and
                asserted that everything should continue <i>"as planned"</i>, but did not elaborate any further on exactly
                what this entailed:

                Clearly, whatever plan for Jan 6 the <b>MOSD</b> leadership had devised was not entirely
                clear even to senior leaders like <b>Joe Biggs</b> on the day before the big event. <b>Johnny Blackbeard</b>
                seemed to believe that whatever plans leadership devised initially had now completely <i>"broken down"</i>. It's also 
                worth noting that after dismissing the idea of smaller teams, <b>Jeremy Bertino</b> 
                said that everything should <i>"move forward as planned <b>for the rally</b> tomorrow"</i>.
                It's a subtle point, but <b>Jeremy Bertino</b> explicitly refers to the Jan 6 plans as
                plans <i>"<b>for the rally</b> tomorrow"</i>, which really isn't the sort of phrasing I would
                expect if <b>Jeremy Bertino</b> was actually referring to some secret plan to storm the Capitol here.
                Rather, the phrasing suggests that <b>Jeremy Bertino</b> thinks of the Jan 6 plan as a plan <i><b>for
                a rally</b></i>, rather than a plan for some kind of illegal, covert operation to overtake the US Capitol
                building.
                <br><br>
                Regardless, the confusion over plans continued through January 5th and into January 6th itself. On the night of
                January 4th, senior <b>MOSD</b> leader <b>Ethan Nordean</b> (Rufio) was apparently
                <a href="https://sigsegv1980.github.io/j6/ProudBoys-MOSD-MAIN2-2021-1-4_2021-1-5.pdf">put in charge of
                the Jan 6 operation</a> (see Govt Exhibit <b>510-9</b>). But then on the evening of January 5, it
                seems the <b>MOSD</b> leaders were having <a href="https://sigsegv1980.github.io/j6/ProudBoys-MOSD-MAIN2-2021-1-4_2021-1-5.pdf">trouble 
                even getting in touch with <b>Ethan Nordean</b></a> (see Govt Exhibit <b>510-23</b>) due to mobile service outages
                in D.C., and
                at one point comments were made indicating <b>Enrique Tarrio</b> would soon retake control
                of the operation:

                At around 9:22 PM on the evening of Jan 5, <b>Joe Biggs</b> posted a message in the 
                <a href="https://sigsegv1980.github.io/j6/ProudBoys-NewMOSD-2021-1-4_2021-1-13.pdf"><b>New MOSD</b> Telegram group</a>,
                informing the other MOSD leaders that <i>"we have a plan. I'm with rufio"</i> (see Govt Exhibit <b>509-23</b>). 
                It seems <b>Joe Biggs</b> or <b>Ethan Nordean</b> (Rufio) came up with
                some plan or sketch of a plan, but no specific details were provided over Telegram except the location of
                the initial morning meetup.
                It's possible the initial meeting place was
                the extent of Biggs' "plan" at the time. Whatever the case may be, it seems that <b>Joe Biggs</b> came up
                with this plan with little or no input from <b>Enrique Tarrio</b>, because after
                Biggs mentioned the plan and initial meetup location, <b>Jeremy Bertino</b> warned <i>"If Enrique has a better idea he needs to say
                it soon."</i>
                <br><br>
                At this point, on the evening of January 5, <b>Enrique Tarrio</b> was hanging out in a hotel in Baltimore after
                he was <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20220712213106/https://twitter.com/maustermuhle/status/1346521554855874565">arrested in D.C. on January 4th</a> 
                and ordered by a judge to leave D.C. immediately. Tarrio joined the <b>New MOSD</b> 
                Telegram group at <b>9:20 PM</b> on January 5 at the invitation of <b>Jeremy Bertino</b>, but Tarrio didn't 
                participate in any discussions included in the Telegram exhibits. Regardless, on the
                evening of January 5th, a mere <i>twelve hours</i> before the big event, <b>Enrique Tarrio</b> and <b>Ethan Nordean</b>
                were mostly "missing in action"
                and senior <b>MOSD</b> leaders were <i>still</i> asking basic questions about "the plan", which at this point

                Less than <i>an hour</i> before the <b>insurrection</b> began and a mob of Trump supporters breached the
                outermost barricade by the Peace Circle, some of the rank-and-file Proud Boys began 
                <a href="https://sigsegv1980.github.io/j6/ProudBoys-MOSD-MAIN2-2021-1-4_2021-1-5.pdf">complaining
                about a <b>general lack of planning and leadership</b></a> (see Govt Exhibit <b>510-32</b>). Lacking direction from their leaders, some
                groups of Proud Boys went off on their own to march around D.C. autonomously. In an attempt
                to improve morale and offer some leadership, <b>Johnny Blackbeard</b> posted relatively
                long voice messages in <a href="https://sigsegv1980.github.io/j6/ProudBoys-NewMOSD-2021-1-4_2021-1-13.pdf">

                telling the other Proud Boys 
                <i>"…don’t anybody lose hope"</i>. <b>Johnny Blackbeard</b> lamented the numerous difficulties
                that adversely impacted the planning for Jan 6, such as <b>Enrique Tarrio</b>'s arrest, and promised
                to conduct an <i>"after action report session"</i> to talk about what went wrong and <i>"make adjustments
                for the next time."</i> <b>Johnny Blackbeard</b> reassured the Proud Boys that <i>"this is gonna be an iterative
                thing"</i> that would improve over time, and finished his voice message by telling everyone to <i>"do
                your best, have a good time."</i>
                <br><br>
                That really doesn't sound like the words of someone harboring secret plans to attack the US Capitol building.
                Rather, <b>Johnny Blackbeard's</b> assurance that things would improve over time (<i>"this is gonna be an iterative thing"</i>)
                is consistent with <b>Zach Rehl</b>'s statements during the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9HY3IVStIJc"><B>December 30 MOSD Zoom meeting</b></a>

                In conclusion, the indictment selectively quotes Telegram messages to suggest the Proud Boys had a secret, detailed plan to storm the Capitol, devised in advance of Jan 6.
                But there is simply no evidence that any such plan existed. The Telegram evidence shows that the <b>MOSD</b> leadership came up with <i>some</i> kind of plan 
                or itinerary for January 6 (likely very similar to the <a href="https://sigsegv1980.github.io/j6/ProudBoys-EastCoastRallyCommandChat.pdf">
                <b>itinerary for the previous D.C. rally on December 12, 2020</b></a>), but it was seemingly devised at the 
                last minute under confusing circumstances, and it was communicated very poorly to both the rank-and-file Proud Boys and 
                the <b>MOSD</b> leadership.

                Included in the indictment to highlight how the Proud Boys used communication equipment (<a href="https://www.baofengradio.com/"><b>Baofeng</b> hand-held radios</a>)
                to coordinate with each other on Jan 6. Once again, the prosecution relies on natural <b>confirmation bias</b> to 
                lead the jury to interpret <i>any</i> hints of planning or coordination among the Proud Boys, including the use of 
                hand-held radios, as evidence <i>specifically</i> of a <b>seditious conspiracy</b> to storm the Capitol.
                Of course, the Proud Boys regularly used hand-held radios and other communication equipment at rallies, and the use
                of such equipment alone is certainly insufficient to demonstrate the existence of a secret plan to storm the Capitol.
                <br><br>
                Of much greater significance here is the inclusion of <b>Aaron Wolkind</b>'s instructive warning that <i>"<b>cops are 
                the primary threat</b>, don't get caught by them or BLM"</i>. This was included in the indictment because the
                prosecution wanted to convince the jury that the Proud Boys saw the cops as antagonists because the Proud Boys
                were planning to attack the Capitol, which necessarily would entail attacking the police who defend the Capitol.
                Indeed, the prosecution argued that any evidence of anti-police sentiment among the Proud Boys is also evidence that 
                the Proud Boys conspired and planned in advance to attack police on Jan 6 as part of the plan to storm the Capitol.
                <br><br>
                However, this ignores a great deal of historical context that explains the Proud Boys' developing antagonism towards the cops,
                apart from any secret plans to attack the US Capitol. (See the above discussion analyzing the <a href="#anc20">Proud Boys' evolving attitude towards the cops</a>.)
                Historically, the Proud Boys were generally <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20200605014442/https://twitter.com/philadelphiapb/status/1268719711602315264">
                supportive of the police</a>, especially before December of 2020. On December 12, 2020, during the second <b>"Million MAGA
                March"</b> rally in D.C., four Proud Boys (including <b>Jeremy Bertino</b>) <a href="https://mpdc.dc.gov/release/arrest-made-assault-dangerous-weapon-knife-offense-500-block-11th-street-northwest">
                got stabbed during an altercation with a counter-protester</a> (whom the Proud Boys believed to be <b>Antifa</b>-affiliated) 
                outside a D.C. bar. During the same rally, <b>Enrique Tarrio</b> decided to steal a <i>Black Lives Matter</i> banner 
                hanging outside Asbury United Methodist Church, and <a href="https://sigsegv1980.github.io/j6/ProudBoys-EnriqueTarrioArrestAffidavit-BLMBannerBurning.pdf">
                burn it publicly on the street</a> (or at least, take credit for burning it). The incident was framed as
                <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20201213224106/https://www.nbcnews.com/news/us-news/black-lives-matter-signs-burned-d-c-churches-police-investigate-n1251050">
                a <b>hate crime</b></a> by some media outlets and the D.C. Metro police, despite the fact that Tarrio himself is black.
                <br><br>
                Finally, as the Proud Boys navigated the streets of D.C. during the night of December 12, 2020, they were

                The prosecution argued that the Proud Boys turned 
                against the police because the Proud Boys planned to attack the Capitol and therefore necessarily had to attack the police who defend it.
                But the historical context involving the December 12th rally <i>independently</i> explains why the Proud Boys turned against the police.
                We know <i>exactly</i> why the Proud Boys turned against the cops, and it had nothing to do with January 6.
                <br><br>
                Finally, it's worth noting that even without any knowledge of this historical context, Proud Boy <b>Aaron Wolkind's</b> message, quoted
                in the indictment, doesn't actually support the prosecution's case. Wolkind said: <i>"cops are the primary threat, don't get caught by 
                them or BLM, don't get drunk until off the street."</i> This is an example of a statement that can be framed as either incriminating
                <i>or</i> <b>exculpatory</b>. I would argue that Wolkind's statement is more naturally interpreted as
                <b><i>exculpatory</i></b>.
                <br><br>
                If we assume, as the prosecution does,
                that <b>Aaron Wolkind</b> had in mind a secret plan to storm the Capitol when he advised the Proud Boys that <i>"cops
                are the primary threat"</i>, we have to wonder what exactly Wolkind even meant when he said <i>"don't get drunk until off the street"</i>.
                If Wolkind knew there was a secret plan to attack the Capitol (and presumably occupy it for some time) then he should have had no reason to tell
                the other Proud Boys to avoid getting drunk until <i>"off the street"</i>. What does <i>"off the street"</i> even mean in this context?
                When Wolkind said <i>"off the street"</i>, did he mean "inside the Capitol building"?
                Is <b>Aaron Wolkind</b> telling the other Proud Boys to wait until they're <i>inside</i> the Capitol building to get drunk?
                <br><br>
                Clearly, <b>Aaron Wolkind's</b> advisory message here makes little sense within the context of some secret plan to attack
                the US Capitol building. But Wolkind's warning to avoid getting drunk <i>"until off the street"</i> makes perfect sense if we 
                assume the Proud Boys' plans for January 6 were more or less similar to <a href="https://sigsegv1980.github.io/j6/ProudBoys-EastCoastRallyCommandChat.pdf">
                <b>itineraries from past D.C. rallies</b></a>, which generally involved 
                day-time marches through the street, followed by drinking and socializing at D.C. bars in the evening. Thus, <b>Aaron Wolkind</b> was
                telling the Proud Boys not to get drunk until after the official rally ends, which is consistent with earlier discussions
                during the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9HY3IVStIJc"><b>December 30 MOSD Zoom meeting</b></a> (see

                when <b>MOSD</b> leadership 
                warned rank and file Proud Boys not to get drunk during rallies (timestamp <b>4:57</b>).

                <a href="https://sigsegv1980.github.io/j6/ProudBoys-USAvCharlesDonohoe-PowerPointShowingExhibits.pdf">Government Exhibit for
                a detention hearing</a> for Proud Boy <b>Charles Donohoe</b> (<b>YutYut Cowabunga</b> on Telegram), 
                a second-tier <b>MOSD</b> leader.
                <br><br>
                The exhibit presents a Telegram conversation held on the morning of January 6, 2021, in the
                <a href="https://sigsegv1980.github.io/j6/ProudBoys-NewMOSD-2021-1-4_2021-1-13.pdf"><b>New MOSD</b> group chat</a>,
                between <b>Charles Donohoe</b>, <b>Aaron Wolkind</b>, <b>Jeremy Bertino</b>, and <b>John Charles Stewart</b> (<b>Johnny Blackbeard</b>).
                Only <b>Charles Donohoe</b> is identified by name in the actual government exhibit. 
                The reason for the inclusion of this conversation in the detention hearing exhibit is obvious: it captures
                the Proud Boys saying some insane shit, beginning with <b>Aaron Wolkind</b>'s desire to see
                <i>"thousands of normies burn [Washington DC] to ash today"</i>. <b>Jeremy Bertino</b>
                chimes in, agreeing that such a thing <i>"would be epic"</i>. 
                <br><br>
                Then <b>John Charles Stewart</b> (<b>Johnny Blackbeard</b>) takes the conversation in a new direction
                by expressing his animosity towards the police, saying he would settle for watching the normies
                (meaning run-of-the-mill Trump supporters) <i>"smash some pigs to dust"</i> (i.e. attack the cops)
                on January 6. <b>Johnny Blackbeard</b> then assures the other Proud Boys that the normies are likely
                to attack the police, because normies have no <i>"adrenaline control"</i>. Finally, <b>Johnny Blackbeard</b>
                expresses resentment over <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20210106002928/https://www.washingtonpost.com/local/public-safety/proud-boys-enrique-tarrio-arrest/2021/01/04/8642a76a-4edf-11eb-b96e-0e54447b23a1_story.html">
                <b>Enrique Tarrio</b>'s arrest</a> back on January 4 (for

                burning a <i>Black Lives Matter</i> 
                banner</a> owned by a church during the previous MAGA rally back in December),
                believing that the D.C. police <i>"went too far when 
                [they] arrested [Enrique] as a scare tactic"</i>.
                <br><br>
                This exhibit exemplifies the Proud Boys' <b>violent rhetoric</b>, and probably didn't help their chances at trial either.
                Additionally, the prosecution can frame these Telegram posts as evidence of the Proud Boys'
                secret plot to <i>"rile up a mob of normies"</i>, overwhelm the police, and storm the Capitol. After 
                all, <b>Johnny Blackbeard</b>'s comments somewhat telegraph all that, as he fantasizes about
                <i>"thousands of normies"</i> smashing the <i>"pigs to dust"</i>, then more or less <i>prophesies</i>
                that exactly such a thing is likely to happen because the <i>"normiecons"</i> (normal conservatives) have 
                no <i>"adrenaline control"</i>.
                <br><br>
                However, the Proud Boys' fondness for violent rhetoric is not evidence of a <b>seditious conspiracy</b>.
                So we're left with their animosity towards the cops and their violent fantasies about a horde of "normies"
                attacking the cops. The prosecution often tried to lead the jury to interpret evidence of the Proud Boys' animosity towards police
                as evidence of a pre-planned <b>seditious conspiracy</b> to attack police and storm the US Capitol. However, the Proud Boys
                were <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20200605014442/https://twitter.com/philadelphiapb/status/1268719711602315264">
                historically <b>quite supportive of the police</b></a>. Their animosity towards the police developed mostly

                <br><br>
                What about <b>Johnny Blackbeard</b>'s "prophecy" about normies with no adrenaline control attacking the police?
                Well, it turns out <b>Johnny Blackbeard</b> was <i>not</i> actually telegraphing the events of January 6. Rather,
                his imagination turned to the idea of "normies attacking police" because <b>Johnny Blackbeard</b> had recently
                personally witnessed a crowd of regular Trump supporters nearly attack the police during the previous D.C. rally 
                on December 12, 2020. During a 
                <a href="https://sigsegv1980.github.io/j6/ProudBoys-MOSDChat-2020-12-20_2021-1-4.pdf">private Telegram conversation in the <b>MOSD</b> chat group</a>
                (see Govt Exhibit <b>501-40</b>) back on December 30, 2020, the Proud Boys were discussing the possibility that <b>Enrique Tarrio</b> 
                would be arrested at the hands of the D.C. Metro police (for 
                <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20201214214021/https://mpdc.dc.gov/release/suspects-sought-destruction-property-offense-900-block-11th-street-northwest">burning a

                Jan 6 or the Capitol building. Both <b>Jeremy Bertino</b> and <b>Johnny Blackbeard</b> brought up concerns about the possibility of normies
                flipping out and attacking police if <b>Enrique Tarrio</b> were to be arrested in public near a crowd of "normie" Trump supporters:

                Clearly, the idea of "normies attacking cops" came up among the Proud Boys because the Proud Boys actually
                <i><b>witnessed it almost happen</b></i> on December 12, 2020. Thus, merely discussing the idea of "normies
                attacking police" is not evidence in itself that the Proud Boys were actually <i><b>counting on</b></i> normies
                attacking the police as an integral component of a secret <b>seditious conspiracy</b> to storm the Capitol on Jan 6.
                It's worth noting that in the 12/30/2020 discussion quoted above, <b>Johnny Blackbeard</b> brought up the possibility
                of "normies attacking police" as a <i>concern</i> - not something he necessarily hoped would happen or
                outright planned to <i>make happen</i>. It's also worth noting that when <b>Johnny Blackbeard</b> brought
                up a similar concern about the possibility of rank-and-file Proud Boys attacking cops, <B>Enrique Tarrio</b>
                dismissed the idea as unlikely, saying 
                <i><a href="https://sigsegv1980.github.io/j6/ProudBoys-MOSDChat-2020-12-20_2021-1-4.pdf">"They’re not gonna punch cops"</i></a> (see Govt Exhibit <b>501-40</b>).</i>
                Again, this discussion happened only a week before Jan 6. Yet the prosecution claimed the Proud Boys leadership
                was expressly <i>relying on</i> rank-and-file Proud Boys (as well as normies) to <i>"punch cops"</i> as a key component of their secret
                <b>seditious conspiracy</b> to storm the Capitol.
                <br><br>
                Of course, on the day of Jan 6, the <a href="https://sigsegv1980.github.io/j6/ProudBoys-NewMOSD-2021-1-4_2021-1-13.pdf">
                discussion in the <b>New MOSD</b> chat group</a> (Govt Exhibit <b>509-26</b>), <a href="#anc36">quoted above</a> in the left column, clearly shows <b>Johnny Blackbeard</b> 
                venting his anger at the cops and fantasizing
                about normies attacking police. But as an evidentiary exhibit designed to showcase the Proud Boys'
                <b>violent rhetoric</b>, the conversation between <b>Charles Donohoe</b> and the other Proud 
                Boys quoted in the <a href="https://sigsegv1980.github.io/j6/ProudBoys-USAvCharlesDonohoe-PowerPointShowingExhibits.pdf">Detention Hearing Exhibit</a>
                (quoted above in the left column) is probably one of the <i>worst</i> possible examples the prosecution
                could have used to make their point. The exhibit itself hides the names of everyone involved except
                for <b>Charles Donohoe</b>, but the Telegram chat exhibits themselves reveal the Proud Boys who said these
                things: <b>Aaron Wolkind</b>, <b>Jeremy Bertino (Noble Beard)</b>, and <b>John Charles Stewart (Johnny Blackbeard)</b>.
                <br><br>
                As it turns out, <i>none</i> of these guys were even in Washington D.C. on January 6th. The only person 
                in the quoted discussion who
                was actually <i>on the ground</i> in D.C. on Jan 6 and actually <i>participated</i> in the Capitol riot was <b>Charles Donohoe</b> (YutYut Cowabunga),
                and he never said anything about "normies attacking police". In fact, <b>Charles Donohoe</b> didn't even participate in
                the discussion about "normies" at all. Of course, in a <b>seditious conspiracy</b> trial like this, it isn't necessary to prove
                that the conspirators physically attacked the Capitol themselves, only that they helped to <i>plan</i>
                such an attack. But no evidence of any such plan exists, unless you count exhibits like this where the
                Proud Boys privately vent their anger towards the cops or the election. Moreover, the fact that none of the people venting their 
                violent fantasies about "normies attacking
                cops" were even present on the ground in D.C. on Jan 6 certainly at least <i>weakens</i> the impact of this exhibit.
                <br><br>
                Moreover,
                the exhibit itself is not evidence of a plan to storm the Capitol. It actually has nothing to do with the Capitol
                or at all. It's merely evidence of the fact that
                some Proud Boys were angry at the police. And <a href="#anc20">
                as demonstrated above</a>, the Proud Boys' anger towards the cops had nothing to do
                with any secret plan to storm the Capitol and everything to do with their experience at the previous
                D.C. rally in December.

                This was not included in the indictment despite being obviously beneficial for the prosecution. This
                Telegram post, and other similar posts, were most likely not included in the indictment because the
                Proud Boys who posted them were not present in D.C. on Jan 6 (they were monitoring the situation from home) and not
                charged as one of the main conspirators in the indictment. I've included this Telegram post here in this
                document simply to remind the reader that the Proud Boys trial
                was not about physically storming the Capitol, rather it was about <i>planning</i> and conspiring <i>before</i> January 6 
                to storm the Capitol. There is no
                doubt that some Proud Boys participated in the Jan 6 Capitol riots and that many Proud Boy leaders,
                including <b>Jeremy Bertino</b> and <b>Enrique Tarrio</b>, celebrated the events of Jan 6 <i>after</i>
                the mob of Trump supporters breached through barricades and stormed the Capitol building.
                <br><br>
                Indeed, <b>Enrique Tarrio</b> didn't even hide the fact he approved of the Trump mob storming the Capitol.
                He <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20210110195804/https://parler.com/post/cd16d7922945425ebf1ace91abdcbef3">posted publicly on Parler</a>,

                However, the Telegram evidence does provide some exculpatory insights, by allowing us to determine the location
                of various groups of Proud Boys the moment the Capitol riot began. The first barricade at the

                When the <a href="https://sigsegv1980.github.io/j6/ZachRehlVideoAtPeaceCircle.mp4">
                first barricade at the Peace Circle was breached</a>, <b>Joseph Biggs</b>
                and <b>Ethan Nordean</b> were near the Peace Circle and among the first wave of rioters who breached
                the barricade. This definitely supports the prosecution's case. But other Proud Boys,
                such as <b>Matthew "The People's Chairman" Walter</b>, had to be told to head towards the Capitol
                <i>after</i> the mob began storming it. And another <b>MOSD</b> Proud Boy using the Telegram handle
                <b>"Captain"</b> was all the way over by the White 
                House, <a href="https://www.google.com/maps/dir/The+White+House,+1600+Pennsylvania+Avenue+NW,+Washington,+DC+20500/U.S.+Capitol+Building,+Washington,+DC/@38.8905033,-77.0153833,16z/data=!4m14!4m13!1m5!1m1!1s0x89b7b7bcdecbb1df:0x715969d86d0b76bf!2m2!1d-77.0365298!2d38.8976763!1m5!1m1!1s0x89b7b82921a2cf17:0x482a3f7c10cf8c4!2m2!1d-77.0090505!2d38.8899389!3e2?entry=ttu&g_ep=EgoyMDI0MTExMi4wIKXMDSoASAFQAw%3D%3D">
                <b>over two miles</b></a> from the Capitol building, when the riot started.
                <br><br>
                If the Proud Boys had a plan to storm the Capitol, devised in advance of January 6, why weren't they
                all positioned close to the Capitol building when the riot started?
                <br><br>
                Of course, some high-ranking Proud Boys, like <b>Joseph Biggs</b> and <b>Ethan Nordean</b>, <i>were</i>
                near the Capitol building (by the Peace Circle) when
                the first barricade was breached. While this fact certainly helped the prosecution, the location of Biggs
                and Nordean by the Capitol building is easy to explain, whether or not any secret conspiracy to
                attack the Capitol building ever existed. Many ordinary Trump supporters began walking towards the Capitol building during
                President Trump's speech at the Ellipse, and the Proud Boys simply marched along with the crowd.
                <br><br>
                Thus, while the existence of a secret, pre-planned conspiracy to storm the Capitol can explain
                the locations of Biggs and Nordean, such a conspiracy <i>can't account</i>
                for the fact that at the moment the Capitol riot began, groups of <b>MOSD</b> Proud Boys were dispersed
                across various locations relatively far (in terms of walking distance) from the Capitol building. But if we instead assume
                there never was any conspiracy, it's easy to explain why many Proud Boys were off marching elsewhere when the riot began. Moreover, 
                the hypothesis that no formal plan to storm the Capitol ever existed
                is already strongly supported by other Telegram evidence. For example, on the morning of January 6, less than two 
                hours before the mob breached the outer barricades and stormed the Capitol, many senior
                Proud Boy leaders were <a href="https://sigsegv1980.github.io/j6/ProudBoys-NewMOSD-2021-1-4_2021-1-13.pdf">

                On the morning of January 6, less than <i>an hour</i> before the riot started, another Proud Boy (using the Telegram handle <b>"Do you want total war?"</b>)
                complained that the plan for Jan 6 was, if anything, the <i>same</i> plan the Proud Boys had used
                back on <b>December 12, 2020</b>, during the second
                <b>"Million MAGA March"</b> rally in DC. In other words, the plan was a <a href="https://sigsegv1980.github.io/j6/ProudBoys-EastCoastRallyCommandChat.pdf">
                <b>typical itinerary for a typical Proud Boy march around DC</b></a>, not
                some <b>seditious conspiracy</b> to storm the Capitol building. When one Proud Boy leader said he was off <i>"eating and chilling"</i>
                with his own chapter, <b>Jeremy Bertino</b> - one of the senior <b>MOSD</b> leaders - didn't respond by saying
                something like "Get your ass over to the Capitol building ASAP like we planned!!". Instead, <b>Jeremy Bertino</b>
                responded casually by asking: <i>"[So you're] not watching Trump?"</i>

                Thus, the Telegram evidence makes it <i>abundantly clear</i> that on the morning of January 6, 
                the Proud Boys had no concept of any formal plan to storm the Capitol. Rather, different groups of <b>MOSD</b>-affiliated Proud Boys
                were spread around D.C. marching autonomously with little centralized leadership. One group was
                still over by the White House 30 minutes <i>after</i> the mob began storming the Capitol building. Other Proud Boys
                were off marching elsewhere, and only approached the Capitol <i>after</i> the riot was already in progress. 
                <br><br>
                On the morning of January 6, before the riot began, a group of Proud Boys led by <b>Ethan Nordean</b> 
                and <b>Joe Biggs</b> marched around the streets of DC, chanting slogans and looking for <b>Antifa</b>. 
                This early morning march was comprehensively <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oSOsG5kN5wc">
                <b>captured on video by documentary filmmaker Eddie Block</b></a> in an unedited one hour and 40 minute livestream.
                <b>Eddie Block</b> <a href="https://youtu.be/oSOsG5kN5wc?t=2033">followed the Proud Boys around</a> the streets of DC in 
                his motorized wheelchair. Occasionally, individual Proud Boys would stop to help
                <a href="https://youtu.be/oSOsG5kN5wc?t=1556">carry Eddie over obstacles or down concrete steps</a>. 
                <br><br>
                As a valuable source of exculpatory evidence, <b>Eddie Block's</b> livestream brings into focus a recurring theme with the prosecution's <b>seditious conspiracy</b>
                case: the prosecution often tried to frame <i>standard</i> or <i>routine</i> things the Proud Boys regularly did at rallies 
                as <i>suspicious</i> behavior indicative of a secret plot to storm the Capitol. This worked out pretty well for the prosecution,
                since the average person (and average jury member) has no idea what the Proud Boys actually do at rallies. The jury
                needed to first be taught what was <i>expected</i> to happen at a <i>typical</i> Proud Boy rally before being asked to 
                assess what happened on January 6.
                <br><br>
                Watching <a href="https://youtu.be/oSOsG5kN5wc?t=2880"><b>Eddie Block's</b> livestream</a>, we see the Proud Boys
                <a href="https://youtu.be/oSOsG5kN5wc?t=2399">marching around DC</a> chanting slogans, <a href="https://youtu.be/oSOsG5kN5wc?t=2051">taking group photos</a>, and 
                <a href="https://youtu.be/oSOsG5kN5wc?t=2726">mingling with ordinary Trump supporters</a>. While the Proud Boys
                understood January 6 to be a bit different from previous rallies (mostly because of the <a href="#anc15">new <b>MOSD</b> structure</a>), it's clear
                that much of what the Proud Boys are seen doing throughout <b>Eddie Block's</b> livestream matches what we know of the
                <a href="https://sigsegv1980.github.io/j6/ProudBoys-EastCoastRallyCommandChat.pdf"><b>itineraries for previous Proud Boy rallies in DC</b></a>, 
                which included <b>Enrique Tarrio's</b> mandate to <i>"[W]in hearts and minds. Shake hands
                kiss babies. Let the people know who the Proud Boys are"</i> and <i>"recruit patriots to join as as we enjoy a march through the streets of DC"</i>.
                This sort of concern with "public relations" and promoting the Proud Boy "brand" is clearly evident in <b>Eddie Block's</b>
                Jan 6 livestream. It's also consistent with the fact that half of the <b>MOSD</b> chapter's <a href="#anc15">upper-tier leadership was part of
                <b>"Marketing"</b></a>.
                <br><br>
                On the morning of January 6, the Proud Boys
                seemed focused mostly on finding local <b>Antifa</b>, their <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20171016061411/http://gothamist.com/2017/02/03/nyu_proud_boy_protest.php">
                long-time street rivals</a>.
                As the Proud Boys marched down <b>Constitution Ave NW,</b> they
                often <a href="https://youtu.be/oSOsG5kN5wc?t=538">chanted <b><i>"Fuck Antifa!"</i></b> and <b><i>"Whose streets? Our streets!"</i></b></a>,
                both typical chants often heard during Proud Boy marches. But the <a href="https://youtu.be/oSOsG5kN5wc?t=2905"><b>"Fuck Antifa"</b> chant</a> was the most common chant
                throughout the morning of Jan 6. Indeed, towards
                the end of <b>Eddie Block's</b> livestream, mere <i>minutes</i> before the first barricade was breached and the Capitol riot began,
                the Proud Boys were 
                <i><b>still</b></i> marching down Constitution Ave <a href="https://youtu.be/oSOsG5kN5wc?t=5590">chanting <b>"Fuck Antifa!"</b> and <b>"Where's Antifa?"</b></a>&nbsp;
                Additionally, <b>Eddie Block</b> often made comments about <b>Antifa</b> as he livestreamed,
                such as <a href="https://youtu.be/oSOsG5kN5wc?t=3125">
                <i>"If you're Antifa and you're out there come find us! We're looking for you!"</i></a> (timestamp <b>52:05</b>) and 
                <a href="https://youtu.be/oSOsG5kN5wc?t=2711"><i>"We're letting Antifa know we run this town!"</i></a> (timestamp <b>45:11</b>).
                <br><br>
                While it's clear the Proud Boys were focused more on <b>Antifa</b> (who never showed up) than any imagined Capitol-related <b>seditious conspiracy</b>, the prosecution
                pointed out that both <b>Joseph Biggs</b> and <b>Ethan Nordean</b> were very close to the first barricade when
                it was breached by the mob at around <b>12:52 PM</b>. Yet as we can see from the livestream, <b>Biggs</b> and <b>Nordean</b> — 
                <i>still</i> chanting <b>"Fuck Antifa!"</b> — 
                simply <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oSOsG5kN5wc&t=5574s">followed the large crowd of Trump supporters</a> 
                to the Capitol building after President Trump's 
                speech concluded. Shortly before the first barricade was breached, <b>Joseph Biggs</b>
                and <b>Ethan Nordean</b> were taking a break from the march, eating and socializing by <a href="https://youtu.be/oSOsG5kN5wc?t=4257">
                a line of food trucks parked</a> on Constitution Avenue,
                north of the Capitol building.
                The Proud Boys resumed their march at around the time the crowd started heading towards the Capitol building.
                Naturally, <b>Biggs</b>, <b>Nordean</b>, and their contingent of Proud Boys, decided to march alongside this crowd towards the Capitol
                (again while still <a href="https://youtu.be/oSOsG5kN5wc?t=5620">chanting <b>"Fuck Antifa!"</b></a>).
                <br><br> 
                But there's no evidence any Proud Boy knew the pro-Trump mob was about to tear down barricades and storm the Capitol, and there
                wouldn't necessarily have been any cause for alarm (at least not at first) when the crowd started walking towards the Capitol building. Indeed, the
                <b>National Park Service</b> (the agency that issued all the
                <a href="https://sigsegv1980.github.io/j6/KylieKremer-Jan6PermitForWomenForAmericaFirst-Amended.pdf"><b>permits</b> for the official protest events</a> 
                held on US Capitol grounds) 
                was actually <i>expecting</i> to see <a href="https://sigsegv1980.github.io/j6/CindyChafian-PermitEmailsWithNPSForJan6Event.pdf">
                <i>"large groups of unorganized individuals [traveling] between the Ellipse and the US Capitol throughout the day"</i></a> (page 61 of PDF). It
                was completely expected that after President Trump finished speaking at around <b>1:00 PM</b>, portions of the crowd would 
                <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20210104133442/https://marchtosaveamerica.com/">head to the US Capitol building</a> where
                they were expected to participate in <a href="https://sigsegv1980.github.io/j6/Jan6MAGARallyMapGuideFull.pdf"><b>officially scheduled protest events</b></a>, 
                such as <b>Ali Alexander's</b> 
                <a href="https://sigsegv1980.github.io/j6/USCapitolPolicePermitsForEventsNearCapitol.pdf">"One Nation Under God" rally</a>
                at "Area 8" by the US Capitol, or the <a href="https://sigsegv1980.github.io/j6/LatinosForTrumpJan6Flyer.pdf"><b>"Latinos for Trump"</b> rally at "Area 7"</a>.
                Obviously, all of these official events were moot once the mob began storming the Capitol.
                <br><br>
                <hr>
                <br>
                However, <b>Eddie Block's</b> livestream is not <i>entirely</i> exculpatory — there is at least one incriminating timestamp. At
                <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oSOsG5kN5wc&t=1971s">around timestamp <b>32:52</b></a>, as the Proud Boys stand around east 
                of the Capitol building, one of them can be 
                heard saying
                <i>"let's take the fucking Capitol!"</i>. This happens about an hour before the first barricade is breached. Between this point in
                time and the first breach, the Proud Boys <a href="https://youtu.be/oSOsG5kN5wc?t=2361">left the Capitol grounds</a>, 
                <a href="https://youtu.be/oSOsG5kN5wc?t=2660">marched down Constitution Avenue</a>, took a <a href="https://youtu.be/oSOsG5kN5wc?t=3201">
                lunch break by the food trucks</a>, and then followed the crowd of Trump supporters <a href="https://youtu.be/oSOsG5kN5wc?t=5620">
                back towards the Capitol</a> shortly before the riot began, all while
                frequently <a href="https://youtu.be/oSOsG5kN5wc?t=5700">chanting <b>"Fuck Antifa!"</b></a> The audio in the livestream is
                a bit difficult to make out, but the Proud Boy who said <i>"let's take the fucking Capitol!"</i> was <b>Daniel Lyons Scott</b>
                (a.k.a. <b>Milkshake</b>). Other Proud Boys immediately admonished <b>Daniel Lyons Scott</b>, with one saying <i>"Let’s not fucking yell that, all right?"</i>.
                <b>Ethan Nordean</b> then muttered into his megaphone <i>"It was Milkshake, man... you know, idiot."</i> 
                <br><br>
                Obviously, the
                prosecution would argue that <b>"Milkshake"</b> spilled the beans in public, and was thus harshly silenced by his co-conspirators. The defense
                would argue that <b>"Milkshake"</b> was merely joking around, and the other Proud Boys essentially warned him not to joke publicly about things like that.
                This sort of evidence has to be assessed holistically and weighed against other exculpatory or incriminating evidence. <b>Daniel
                Lyons Scott</b> was a rank-and-file Proud Boy, not a <b>MOSD</b> leader involved in the planning for Jan 6. Moreover, as argued above,
                the concept of "taking/storming/occupying the Capitol" was not some esoteric idea discussed only by the Proud Boys or applicable <i>only</i>
                to January 6th. The idea of "storming" or
                <i>occupying</i> Capitol buildings was a "trope" of the online MAGA-sphere and the 2020 <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20201231183223/https://stopthesteal.us/">
                <b>"Stop the Steal"</b></a>
                movement after Trump lost the election. Between November of 2020 and January 5th, 2021, there were 
                <a href="https://sigsegv1980.github.io/j6/ZenodoParlerPostsFromNovember2020ToJanuary2021WithKeywordStormTheCapitol_IncludingEchoes.html">
                <b>468 Parler posts that exhorted Trump supporters to "storm the Capitol"</b></a> (or some variation of that phrase), and around 
                <a href=https://sigsegv1980.github.io/j6/ParlerPostsUsingOccupyLikeProgressives_2020_IncludingEchoes.html"">
                <b>3,450</b> Parler posts telling Trump supporters to <i>occupy</i> a Capitol building</a> or something similar.

                A conservative media outlet used <a href="https://www.thegatewaypundit.com/2020/11/happening-now-alex-jones-leading-crowd-trump-supporters-storming-georgia-state-capitol-video/">
                the phrase <i>"storming the Capitol"</i></a> to describe a <i><b>legal</b></i> protest held inside the Georgia State Capitol building in November of 2020. Even
                documentary filmmaker <b>Eddie Block</b>, who livestreamed the Proud Boys marching on Jan 6, was initially rather tongue-in-cheek when he
                first saw the MAGA crowd descend upon the US Capitol building, exclaiming <i><b>"Look at this folks! We're storming the Capitol!"</b></i> 
                (<a href="https://youtu.be/oSOsG5kN5wc?t=5923">timestamp <b>1:38:43</b></a>). But as <b>Eddie Block</b> drew
                closer to the melee, he soon realized that people 
                were <i>literally</i> breaking down barricades and storming the Capitol building. Eddie then spoke with a tone of genuine surprise, saying 
                <i><b>"Oh shit! We're tearing it down!"</b></i> (<a href="https://youtu.be/oSOsG5kN5wc?t=5943">timestamp <b>1:39:00</b></a>).
                <br><br>
                Thus, it should be obvious that merely identifying an isolated, non-sequitor usage of the phrase "storm/take the Capitol" is <i>not</i> sufficient
                to prove the existence of a formal plan or conspiracy, devised in advance of January 6, to storm the US Capitol building. Moreover, this type of evidence
                must be weighed against other, extremely compelling <b>exculpatory evidence</b>, such as <a href="https://sigsegv1980.github.io/j6/ProudBoys-BootsOnTheGroundChat.pdf">

                Included in the indictment because it demonstrates that some Proud Boys did, in fact, storm the Capitol. However,
                this fact was never in dispute. Over a thousand people stormed the Capitol, and most were charged with misdemeanors
                related to trespassing or picketing on US Capitol grounds. Just because the Proud Boys participated in the riot
                does not mean they actually planned in advance of Jan 6 to <i>orchestrate</i> the riot, and Telegram
                evidence suggests no such plan ever existed. For example, Proud Boy <b>Zach Rehl</b>, an upper-tier <b>MOSD</b>
                leader directly involved in planning for Jan 6, outright stated (in a private Telegram chat he believed to be secure)
                that he was <a href="https://sigsegv1980.github.io/j6/ProudBoys-BootsOnTheGroundChat.pdf"><b>completely surprised</b></a> 
                (Govt Exhibit <b>512-13</b>) by the fact that hundreds of Trump supporters suddenly began storming the Capitol
                building:
                <br><br>

                Moreover, the Telegram posts quoted here from the indictment are somewhat misleading, because they imply that all three
                Proud Boys involved in the exchange (<b>Aaron Wolkin</b>, <b>Jeremy Bertino</b> and <b>Charles Donohoe</b>) were
                actually <i>on the ground</i> in D.C. storming the Capitol building, when in fact neither <b>Aaron Wolkind</b> nor <b>Jeremy Bertino</b> 
                were even present in Washington D.C.
                on January 6th. Only <b>Charles Donohoe</b> actually participated in the Capitol riot. Also, highlighting a Telegram
                post where a Proud Boy (who wasn't even in D.C. on Jan 6) eagerly suggests throwing <i>"eggs and rotten tomatoes"</i> (presumably
                at the police), isn't exactly the most effective way to paint the Proud Boys as violent insurrectionists. They didn't even bring
                guns.

                Included in the indictment because it emphasizes <b>Dominic Pezzola</b>'s connection to <b>Charles Donohoe</b>. 
                <b>Dominic Pezzola</b> was <a href="#anc16"><b>one of the first rioters</b></a> to breach the Capitol building when he used a stolen riot shield to
                smash a window on the upper terrace. However, <b>Dominic Pezzola</b> was a rank-and-file Proud Boy
                who had little or no input in actually planning for Jan 6. <b>Pezzola</b> became a 
                Proud Boy less than <i>two months</i> before Jan 6 (see <a href="https://sigsegv1980.github.io/j6/j6/2023-04-05-USAvProudBoys-TranscriptOfJuryTrial-Day60.pdf">
                trial testimony of Lisa Magee</a>), and he joined the <a href="https://sigsegv1980.github.io/j6/ProudBoys-MOSD-Main-2020-12-27_2021-1-4.pdf"><b>MOSD MAIN</b> Telegram 
                chat group</a> (see Government Exhibit <b>507-7</b>) as late as January 2, 2021, only <i>4 days</i> before Jan 6, and he rarely posted anything after joining.
                <br><br>
                However, <b>Charles Donohoe</b> (<b>YutYut Cowabunga</b> on Telegram) was a <b>MOSD</b>
                leader who helped organize the <b>MOSD</b> chapter (see the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9HY3IVStIJc">December 30, 2020 <b>MOSD Zoom call</b></a>
                and <a href="https://sigsegv1980.github.io/j6/ProudBoys-2020-12-30-MOSDZoomMeetingTranscript.pdf">full transcript</a>)
                and helped plan <a href="#anc28">the itinerary</a> for Jan 6. But since <b>Dominic Pezzola</b> was one of the first rioters to actually
                breach the Capitol building, the prosecution aggressively called attention to any evidence suggesting <b>Pezzola</b> 
                had an established relationship with other,
                higher-ranking Proud Boys, like <b>Charles Donohoe</b> and <b>Enrique Tarrio</b>. The prosecution wanted the jury to conclude
                that <b>Pezzola</b> was
                a key conspirator who was methodically following orders from the <b>MOSD</b> leadership when he smashed the window, rather than just
                another random rioter engaging in <i>ad hoc</i> violence who happened to be among the first rioters to breach 
                the Capitol building.
                <br><br>
                The prosecution's suggestion that <b>Pezzola</b> smashed the upper terrace window pane as part of
                some elaborate plan, devised by the Proud Boys <i>in advance</i> of Jan 6, to storm the US Capitol building, is significantly weakened by the fact that
                <b>Pezzola</b> was merely one of <i>several</i> first-wave rioters on the upper terrace trying to force their way into the building. <b>Pezzola</b> was not
                even the first rioter to actually penetrate the glass (see <a href="PezzolaSmashingWindowPane-720.mp4"><b>video</b> of <b>Pezzola</b> smashing the window pane</a>)
                or enter the building, 
                and the opening <b>Pezzola</b> created by smashing the window pane was <i>not</i>
                even the same opening used by the first rioter who entered the building. (See the <a href="#anc16">above discussion about <b>Dominic Pezzola</b>
                and the unidentified <b>rioter in red</b></a>.)
                <br><br>
                <b>Dominic Pezzola</b> was ultimately the only Proud Boy acquitted of the <b>seditious conspiracy</b> charge.

                        Because it’s clear to me at this
                        point, the American people, the, you know,
                        air-quotes “patriots,” they’re looking for
                        somebody to save them still. They want us
                        to do it for them. And Proud Boys can’t bear
                        this burden. It’s too big for us alone. We
                        needed them to step up, and all they gave
                        us was 25% of a measure. And now they’re
                        all back home and, uh, yesterday’s events
                        are gonna be used to smash us in ways we
                        couldn’t even imagine. It’s just-- I don’t
                        even know, man. At this point I’m getting
                        ready to get together with my guys and talk
                        about how we’re gonna proceed when all of
                        this shit comes down. Because it is coming
                        down.
