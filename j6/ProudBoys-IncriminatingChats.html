                        if they steal this shit,” referring to the Presidential election.

                Included in the indictment to establish that the Proud Boys were angry about the outcome of the 2020 Presidential election, which they believe was
                stolen, and that they often expressed their anger using violent rhetoric. Meant to establish motive, obviously.
                <br><br>
                The indictment omits the part of Biggs' post that grounds his threat about "fucking War" in a more specific
                historical context. Biggs is likely refering to media reports at the time (whether "fake news" or not) that were claiming that Republican election monitors 
                were blocked from effectively monitoring the vote count in certain locales.

                The indictment omits the original context. <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20201223030510/https://parler.com/post/5fc7afc012ca42169403b0b1de20c308">Enrique Tarrio's Parler

                histrionic claim
                that <i>"[Proud Boys in DC are] approaching black people with handcuffs and threatening to kidnap folk"</i> and suggesting
                that "<i>KILL FIRST ASK LATER</i>" is an appropriate counter-measure. Tarrio's post is meant to ironically
                juxtapose the media focus on violent behavior from the Proud Boys with violent rhetoric coming from a political 
                enemy of the Proud Boys.

                Included in the indictment to emphasize that the Proud Boys upped their recruitment efforts in response to the
                announcement of the upcoming Jan 6 rally in DC, and that they were interested in getting "radical" and recruiting "real men", 
                suggesting to the jury that the Proud Boys were now interested mostly in recruiting people who are willing to engage in 
                political violence. This is also meant to suggest to the jury that the
                Proud Boys started conspiring to storm the Capitol as early as December 19, 2020, beginning with a ramped up recruitment
                effort.

                <br>
                The indictment omits Biggs follow up posts 12 seconds later. Biggs seems to clarify that he didn't mean anything
                in a "crazy way", but the meaning of Biggs' post is ambiguous due to the typo. Further clarifying posts from
                Biggs somewhat soften the impact of "get radical and [recruit] real men" by clarifying that Biggs mostly meant that the
                Proud Boys "need to portray a more masculine vibe" that better reflects how the Proud Boys see themselves. Biggs seems 
                primarily concerned with how the Proud Boys are <i>perceived</i>, which is appropriate given that Biggs was put in charge 
                of "marketing" later that week when the MOSD chapter was established. However, Biggs' focus on public perception is 
                of course compatible with the intended takeaway of this evidence, which is that Biggs (and by extension, the Proud Boys collectively)
                began to recruit "real men" willing to "stand up and fight" (i.e. engage in political violence).
                <br>
                <br>
                However, Tarrio never responds to anything Biggs says here, so the exhibit doesn't really demonstrate that the Proud Boys
                actually ramped up recruitment efforts in any significant way specifically in preparation for Jan 6.

                        on inside.” In response, TARRIO proposed a video chat, which would take place on December 21,
                        to discuss the MOSD and January 6.

                Included in the indictment to suggest to the jury that the Proud Boys were focused on the US Capitol building as early as 12/20/2020, and
                to establish that the Proud Boys were making plans and having Zoom meetings about Jan 6 at that time. 
                <br>
                <br>
                However, like most of the prosecution's evidence, these Telegram posts merely establish that the Proud Boys were planning <i>something</i>, 
                but do nothing to establish <i>WHAT</i> the Proud Boys were planning. For a typical jury member, or anyone unfamiliar with the
                the history of the Proud Boys and political rallies throughout 2020, it's easy to read these posts and assume (due to classic <i>confirmation bias</i>) that
                any discussion about planning for Jan 6, or any mention of the Capitol building, automatically <i>confirms</i> the prosecution's seditious conspiracy case. After 
                all, what <i>else</i> would the Proud Boys be planning on doing there, if not storming the Capitol?
                <br>
                <br>
                But the indictment misleadingly omits significant historical context here that reveals this exchange to be nothing more than typical
                event planning. There were MANY rallies attended by the Proud Boys throughout 2020. 
                In November and December, many of these rallies were organized by a <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20201231183223/https://stopthesteal.us/">coalition of 
                conservative activist loosely united under the "Stop The Steal" slogan/hashtag</a>, including two rallies in Washington D.C. on 
                <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20201118012633/https://www.washingtonpost.com/dc-md-va/2020/11/14/million-maga-march-dc-protests/">November 14</a> 
                and <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20201212160205/https://www.nbcwashington.com/news/local/trump-supporters-maga-rally-protest-dc-saturday/2506267/">December 12</a>, both of
                which were very similar to Jan 6. When the Proud Boys attended a rally, their activities typically involved 
                <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20210110164843/https://video.parler.com/uY/Nb/uYNb0PwARkgL_small.mp4">marching through the streets chanting

                <a href="https://x.com/SRodd_CPR/status/1330258072678363143">ordinary pro-Trump protesters</a>.
                <br>
                <br>
                This is why <b>Johnny Blackheard</b>
                asked <b>Enrique Tarrio</b> "<i>what locations do you absolutely need to stop at?</i>". Blackbeard believed it was likely that Tarrio would
                be giving a speech on stage on Jan 6, which would necessarily affect overall plans for that day, especially given 
                <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20201002154105/https://www.nytimes.com/2020/10/02/us/elections/the-florida-director-of-a-pro-trump-latino-group-is-the-chairman-of-the-proud-boys.html">Tarrio's association with Latinos for Trump</a>, 
                an organization that <a href="https://sigsegv1980.github.io/j6/LatinosForTrumpJan6Flyer.pdf">reserved a stage on Jan 6 near the US Capitol in order to hold a 
                protest/demonstration</a>. Blackbeard then mentions 
                his belief that the protest would mostly be centered around the Capitol building. Far from suggesting any seditious plans, Blackbeard's statement 
                here is simply a reasonable assumption, given that:
                <ul>
                    <li>Congress would be meeting in the Capitol, thus any protesters are likely to congregate near the Capitol</li>
                    <li>
                        Most previous "Stop The Steal" protests took place 
                        <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20201231183223/https://stopthesteal.us/">outside State Capitol buildings or the US Capitol</a>
                    </li>
                    <li>Early <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20201223062953/https://wildprotest.com/">event flyers announcing the Jan 6 rally mentioned the US Capitol grounds</a> 
                    as the main location where various MAGA protests would be held. This was before
                    it was known that President Trump would be speaking at the Ellipse.
                    </li>
                </ul>
                <br>
                The indictment also uses misleading language to suggest that Tarrio setup the Zoom meeting <i>IN RESPONSE</i> to Blackbeard's statement about the
                Capitol, thereby subtly connecting the Capitol building to whatever the Proud Boys discussed during that Zoom call. But Tarrio's response
                came over 20 minutes after Blackbeard's comment, and could just as easily be interpreted as responding to Blackbeard's earlier post asking where Tarrio 
                "<i>absolutely need[s] to stop at</i>" on Jan 6.

                        and others emphasized by telling members, among other things, to “Fit in [] or fuckoff.”

                        don't have a personal issue with you Enrique. I feel like we have put everything on the table

                        Biggs is part of marketing. He's not part of operational. Biggs, enrique, Rufio are the
                        marketing squad. Operational falls under them with Rex, Zach, and Johnny. Marketing
                        approves of the operational side but isn't responsible for creating or running it. Under
                        that there are two regional commanders with 4 guys. The west is still being built. The east

                Included in the indictment to suggest to the jury that the <b>"Ministry of Self Defense" (MOSD)</b> chapter, created by
                Proud Boy chairman <b>Enrique Tarrio</b>, was a strict chapter with a militaristic structure, created mostly 
                for the purpose of planning to storm the US Capitol on Jan 6. The indictment focuses on the rigidly non-democratic 
                nature of MOSD, exemplified by the catch-phrase "<i>fit in or fuck off</i>".
                <br><br>
                The Proud Boys as an organization is <a href="https://sigsegv1980.github.io/j6/ProudBoysConstitutionAndBylaws.pdf">divided into semi-autonomous regional chapters</a>.
                MOSD was a new national-level chapter of the 
                Proud Boys (with multiple associated Telegram chat groups) created on December 20, 2020.
                The indictment oversells the level of strictness enforced by Tarrio and the MOSD leadership. It was certainly no
                democracy, as is clear from the 
                <a href="https://sigsegv1980.github.io/j6/ProudBoys-MOSDProspectsSmall.pdf">initial announcement on Telegram informing other Proud Boys of the new MOSD chapter</a>.
                However, the tone and verbiage used by MOSD leader Zach Rehl during the <b><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9HY3IVStIJc">
                12/30/2020 MOSD Zoom meeting</a></b> (<a href="https://sigsegv1980.github.io/j6/ProudBoys-2020-12-30-MOSDZoomMeetingTranscript.pdf">full transcript</a>)
                reveals that the MOSD chapter wasn't always quite as strict as the indictment would have us believe:

                        <i>[Transcribed audio]: ...one of the biggest things that I want to like, 
                        like stress, everybody that um, you know, the, the "<b>fit in or fuck off</b>" - I mean, <b>it's kind of like a lighthearted joke, but it's also
                        like a serious thing</b>.

                    </div>
                </div>

                The phrase "<b>fit in or fuck off</b>" appeared on the <b><a href="https://sigsegv1980.github.io/j6/ProudBoys-MOSDMemberApplicationForm.pdf">MOSD 
                Application Form</a></b> that Tarrio required prospective members to sign before they were permitted to join MOSD. However, Tarrio only
                actually said this phrase once on Telegram (in the <a href="https://sigsegv1980.github.io/j6/ProudBoys-MOSD-MAIN-FullChatMessages-2020-12-27_2021-1-1.pdf">MOSD MAIN chat group</a>)
                when another Proud Boy named <b>Brien James</b> 
                criticized the structure of MOSD and disapproved of Joe Biggs being assigned a leadership role. Tarrio
                told Brien James to "Fit in...or fuck off". This was really the only occasion (at least on Telegram) where Tarrio strictly enforced
                anything in MOSD. Also, simply reading through a typical <a href="https://sigsegv1980.github.io/j6/ProudBoys-ExportedTelegramChatMOSDOp/messages.html">Proud Boy MOSD Telegram chat</a>
                - often filled with silly memes and vulgar jokes - should immediately dispel the notion that the Proud Boys were even capable of being
                particularly serious on a consistent basis.
                <br><br>
                The indictment also obscures the actual purpose of MOSD and the historical context that prompted its creation. The indictment
                suggests MOSD was created specifically to plan for storming the Capitol on Jan 6. But Telegram chats and 
                <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9HY3IVStIJc">video of the 12/30/2020 MOSD Zoom meeting</a> makes it absolutely clear that MOSD was 
                created to address discipline issues that occurred during previous rallies in Washington DC, specifically the 
                <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20201212160205/https://www.nbcwashington.com/news/local/trump-supporters-maga-rally-protest-dc-saturday/2506267/">December 12th, 2020 rally</a> 
                where Proud Boy <b>Jeremy Bertino</b> (NobleBeard on Telegram) was stabbed and Tarrio had difficulty maintaining control of formations during marches. Thus, during
                the <a a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9HY3IVStIJc">12/30/2020 Zoom meeting</a>, when Jeremy Bertino emphasized the strictness of 
                MOSD (repeating the catch-phrase "fit in or fuck off"),
                he <i>also</i> explained <i>why</i> the new MOSD chapter was so strict, and it had nothing to do with any plans to storm a Capitol:

                that Enrique Tarrio made all prospective MOSD members sign, listing statements that prospective members had to promise to

                hour and a half, yet there is zero discussion about storming the Capitol or doing anything illegal. The entire discussion is mostly about addressing
                disciplinary issues experienced during the last rally, and establishing new protocols (dividing up into small
                groups) to make marching formations easier to maintain and coordinate during rallies.

                establishes that the MOSD chapter was a special chapter, separate from the other Proud Boys. I guess.

                Once again, the full Telegram post contains exculpatory information that was omitted in the indictment. In the full post,
                <b>Enrique Tarrio</b> says that the MOSD will be running "<i>training exercises</i>" during "<i>the 5th at night and 6th throughout the day</i>".
                This is obviously not particularly compatible with the prosecution's seditious conspiracy case. 
                However, it <i>is</i> quite consistent with Tarrio's announcement posted the next day (12/29/2020) in the
                <a href="https://sigsegv1980.github.io/j6/ProudBoys-MOSD-MAIN-FullChatMessages-2020-12-27_2021-1-1.pdf">MOSD MAIN Telegram group</a>, where he said 
                <i>"we are going to be using the 6th as a test [of the new MOSD policies]"</i>.
                <br><br>
                Additionally, Tarrio also tells Group 2 to "<i>conduct themselves as gentlemen and always keep themselves in a self defense mindset</i>".
                This statement is also somewhat exculpatory, and therefore it was unsurprisingly excluded from the indictment.

                This Parler post was extremely important to the prosecution's seditious conspiracy case. In a public announcement on Parler,
                <b>Enrique Tarrio</b> informed his thousands of followers that the Proud Boys will
                <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20201229170859/https://parler.com/post/c741b78505a54150bdf63d079952e8f0">not be wearing their traditional
                black and yellow uniforms on January 6</a>, and will instead show up incognito (in plain clothes). Tarrio also suggests that some or
                all of the Proud Boys that show up in D.C. on January 6 will be dressed in all black.
                <br><br>
                Firstly, Tarrio's statement that the Proud Boys will <i>"spread across downtown DC in smaller teams"</i> is already mostly incompatible
                with the prosecution's seditious conspiracy case, because it's not really clear why spreading out in small teams "across downtown DC"
                makes any sense if the goal is to attack the Capitol building. The indictment glosses over this, focusing on the fact
                that the Proud Boys dressed incognito on Jan 6 instead of <i>"wearing Proud Boys colors that had been prominently displayed at previous events."</i>
                <br><br>
                Throughout the trial, the prosecution maintained that the Proud Boys dressed incognito on January 6th because
                they planned to attack the police and storm the Capitol building, and wanted to avoid being easily identified
                while doing so. The prosecution lumped the "no colors" policy together with other preparations made by the Proud Boys in advance of Jan 6,
                including the fact that the Proud Boys came to D.C. with protective gear (body armor) and walkie-talkies,
                arguing that all of these preparations were part of a pre-planned conspiracy to attack the Capitol.  
                (See paragraph 28 of <a href="https://sigsegv1980.github.io/j6/2022-06-06-USAvEthanNordeanAndJosephBiggsAndZacharyRehlAndEnriqueTarrioAndDominicPezzola-ThirdSupersedingIndictment.pdf">the indictment</a>.)

                    The seditious conspiracy began at least as early as December 19, 2020.
                    Tarrio, Nordean, Biggs, Rehl, and other leaders of the Proud Boys organization intentionally
                    recruited men prepared to engage in physical violence, if necessary. They organized a return to
                    Washington, D.C., which guidance included what to wear (e.g., no colors), what to bring (e.g.,
                    protective gear and communication equipment), and what to do (e.g., fit in or fuck off).

                This is one of the <i>least</i> defensible claims made by the prosecution. Firstly, the Proud Boys regularly

                Secondly, there is <i>overwhelming</i> evidence
                that preparations made by the Proud Boys for Jan 6 (including bringing protective gear and not wearing colors) was 
                <b>in anticipation of violent conflict with Antifa</b>, the Proud Boys' long-time street rivals at political rallies and protests.
                The term <b>"Antifa"</b> is used by the Proud Boys as an umbrella term referring to various regional anti-fascist or anarchist

                In Tarrio's Parler post, his emphasis on the word "black", as in <i>"we might dress in all <b>BLACK</b>"</i> and <i>"[t]he night calls
                for a <b>BLACK</b> tie event"</i>, is a clear reference to the <i>"<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20100703130413/http://www.infoshop.org/amp/bgp/BlackBlockPapers2.pdf">Black Bloc</a>"</i> style clothing

                dressing incognito on January 6th. These other posts leave little doubt that the decision to not wear colors 
                on Jan 6 was directly related to the Proud Boys' conflict with Antifa:

                The mischievous, mocking tone of these Parler posts is consistent with the interpretation that Tarrio and the other Proud Boys
                posted this information <i>publicly</i> on Parler to confuse or intimidate Antifa, with the goal of ultimately being able
                to infiltrate or ambush Antifa. This interpretation is consistent with the fact that Tarrio's post
                ends with a cryptic remark, omitted in the indictment: <i>"48 Laws of Power #3 #4 #14 #15 #17 #29 #37 #39 #48"</i>. This is a 
                clear reference to the rules enumerated in <a href="https://www.amazon.com/48-Laws-Power-Robert-Greene/dp/0140280197">Robert Greene’s 48 Laws of Power</a>, 
                including Rule #3: <i>conceal your intentions</i>, Rule #14: <i>pose as a friend, work as a spy</i>, and Rule #17: <i>keep 
                others in suspended terror - cultivate an air of unpredictability.</i>
                <br><br>
                This interpretation is confirmed by the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9HY3IVStIJc">December 30th, 2020 MOSD Zoom planning
                meeting</a>, where Tarrio explained that the purpose of publicly announcing the "no colors" policy was to conceal the number
                of Proud Boys in D.C. on Jan 6, since Tarrio expected a significantly smaller number of Proud Boys (in comparison with previous D.C. rallies) 
                to attend.

                This is consistent with Proud Boy <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20210110193046/https://parler.com/profile/vigocarpathian">Bill Whicker III's Parler post</a>, 
                where he coyly says <i>"Maybe a few?

                And it's also consistent with <a href="https://sigsegv1980.github.io/j6/ProudBoys-OfficialPresidentsChat-2020-8-7_2020-12-31.pdf">another statement from Tarrio on Telegram</a> 
                (see Government Exhibit <b>514-47</b>) where he explains that one purpose of the "no colors" announcement on Parler was to cultivate fear among Antifa members.
                <br><br>
                All of this paints the picture that the Proud Boys ultimately wanted to avoid being recognized by Antifa on Jan 6. This is the most natural, straightforward
                interpretation of the Parler posts. Indeed, after Tarrio announced the "no colors" policy on Parler, 
                <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20210104151444/https://www.businessinsider.com/proud-boys-attend-january-6-dc-rally-incognito-all-black-2021-1">Business Insider published
                an article</a> about the Proud Boys that simply took it for granted that the purpose of showing up "incognito" on Jan 6 was to blend in with Antifa, since
                this is the most obvious interpretation.
                <br><br>
                On top of all this, several posts from the private 
                <a href="https://sigsegv1980.github.io/j6/ProudBoys-ExportedTelegramChatMOSDOp/messages.html">MOSD Ops Telegram chat group</a> make it <i>indisputably clear</i> that the purpose
                of the "no colors"/incognito policy was to avoid being recognized by Antifa. In this chat, the Proud Boys were
                discussing dressing up in all black like Antifa. Some Proud Boys even

                showing off their attempts to dress like Antifa
                by donning all-black attire and protective gear. Both <b>Joe Biggs</b> and <b>Enrique Tarrio</b> commented that blending in with Antifa
                convincingly would require certain Proud Boys to hide their beards, because Antifa members typically do not have beards:

                <b>These Telegram posts amount to <i>indisputable</i>, "smoking-gun" level evidence that the Proud Boys' purpose in showing up incognito in D.C. on Jan 6
                was to try to blend in with Antifa.</b>
                However, despite all this, the prosecution stubbornly maintained the position that the Proud Boys
                did not wear their normal colors on Jan 6 because they were planning to attack the police.

                Finally, there are numerous discussions across multiple Telegram chat groups where the Proud Boys talk about various personal protective
                equipment and body armor. Very often they mention a need for <i><b>stab proof vests or stab proof body armor</i></b>. Examples include the

                Clearly, the Proud Boys were very interested in acquiring stab proof vests because of "recent events" at the previous D.C. rally in December,
                when multiple Proud Boys 
                <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20201213043848/https://www.the-sun.com/news/1959359/million-maga-march-dc-trump-steal-election-stabbing/">were 
                stabbed by counter-protesters during clashes in the street</a>. The prosecution claimed that the Proud
                Boys brought equipment and body armor to D.C. on Jan 6 in preparation for attacking the police. But a stab proof vest is useless against
                the police, who, unlike Antifa, do not use knives.

                that the MOSD chapter was a militaristic organization created for the express purpose of storming the Capitol building. Additionally, this paragraph
                establishes that the MOSD chapter involved a sophisticated level of planning, with references to a multi-tier leadership structure
                and "Operations" and "Marketing" sections. This shows evidence of planning, but does not show <i>WHAT</i> the Proud Boys were
                planning for Jan 6, again relying on confirmation bias to kick in and lead the jury to interpret any evidence of planning as evidence of a
                seditious conspiracy to storm the Capitol.
                <br><br>
                The indictment omits certain exculpatory or confusing parts of Tarrio's post, such as when he says <i>"we are going to be using the 6th as a test"</i>, which
                doesn't really fit the seditious conspiracy case.
                <br><br>
                More significantly, the indictment brings up the <i>"virtual meeting on December 30"</i>. This Zoom meeting (which lasted over an hour and a half) is
                <b><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9HY3IVStIJc">available on video in its entirety</a></b>. (See also the complete
                <a href="https://sigsegv1980.github.io/j6/ProudBoys-2020-12-30-MOSDZoomMeetingTranscript.pdf">transcript</a>). This video stands
                out as very significant <b>exculpatory evidence</b>. Throughout the entire hour and a half long discussion between MOSD leaders, including
                the "big 3" (Enrique Tarrio, Joe Biggs and Ethan Nordean), there is not a single mention of storming the Capitol or doing anything
                illegal. The meeting establishes the real purpose of the MOSD chapter, which was to address disciplinary problems experienced during the 
                previous D.C. rally on December 14, when Proud Boy <b>Jeremy Bertino</b> was stabbed and Enrique Tarrio had difficulty maintaining control 
                of marching formations. During the meeting the Proud Boys discuss establishing new protocols (like splitting up into small groups) to make it easier 
                to stay in formation while marching through the streets during rallies.

                        self-defense, so escalation of force isn't going to be to go out and attack, um, it's going to be
                        more of like a bodyguard system. So obviously we'll be around
                        the marketing team, a.k.a. the dudes that get
                        all the press and stuff like that, and basically be a bodyguard service for the mission that they're trying
                        accomplish. But that being said, there's also going to be smaller teams that go out and do things
                        like recon and quick reaction force in case somebody gets jammed up in a bind, and also to provide
                        information back to that main element. So as of now, I think we all agree on
                        this with the escalation of force - it's in strictly a defensive mode.
                        Um, unless the threat is so imminent that you believe that your life is in danger.

                Ultimately, the <b><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9HY3IVStIJc">MOSD Zoom meeting video</a></b> suggests that the Proud Boys' real plan for Jan 6 was simply to test out the new
                rallying protocols instituted by the MOSD leadership, which entailed splitting into smaller 10 man groups (timestamp 16:59), not wearing the usual
                Proud Boy colors (timestamp 1:01:09), not getting drunk or high during the rally (4:40), and acting defensively at all times (timestamps 7:48, 32:03, 33:29).

                This is consistent with Tarrio's post on <a href="https://sigsegv1980.github.io/j6/ProudBoys-MOSD-MAIN-FullChatMessages-2020-12-27_2021-1-1.pdf">Telegram in MOSD MAIN</a> 
                saying that <i>"we are going to be using the 6th as a test"</i>.
                It's clear that at the time of the December 30 Zoom meeting, Tarrio hadn't yet fully ironed out an exact plan or itinerary for Jan 6, but he made it clear that
                the plan would involve testing out the new protocols and attending the <a href="https://sigsegv1980.github.io/j6/Jan6MAGARallyMapGuideFull.pdf"><b>official events</b></a> 
                scheduled for the day. Many 
                <a href="https://sigsegv1980.github.io/j6/Jan6MAGARallyMapGuideFull.pdf">rallies and speeches</a>
                were planned for Jan 6, organized by <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20201231141130/https://magafreedomrallydc.com/maga/">various pro-Trump organizations</a> 
                associated with the "Stop the Steal" movement, including <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20210113013334/https://latinosfortrump.us/freedom-rally-jan-6">Latinos For Trump</a>,

                According to the prosecution, <b>Dominic Pezzola</b>, a Proud Boy from New York, was the first person to actually breach the Capitol
                building when he smashed a window with a riot shield (unrelated to the "decorative shield" mentioned in the indictment) that he had
                stolen from a police officer, enabling the large mob of rioters to enter the building.

                    <div class="inner-blurb">
                        At approximately 2:13 p.m., PEZZOLA used the riot shield he had taken from a
                        Capitol Police officer to break a window of the Capitol. The first members of the mob entered the
                        Capitol through this broken window.
                    </div>
                </div>
                Pezzola's defense admitted that Pezzola smashed the window,
                but <a href="2023-08-06-USAvDominicPezzola-DefendantPezzolasReplyToUnitedStatesResponseToPezzolaRule29and33Motions.pdf">
                denied that Pezzola was the first person to actually breach the Capitol</a>, claiming that an unidentified individual wearing a red cap, 
                glasses and a red sweater first broke the pane of glass to the right of where Pezzola broke the window.
                <br><br>
                Pezzola's direct message to Enrique Tarrio is included in the indictment most likely to suggest a close relationship between Tarrio
                and Pezzola. Pezzola (Spazzo - 2nd° on Telegram) was a rank-and-file Proud Boy rather than a leader with any authority or decision making power within
                the MOSD chapter. He clearly had never even met Tarrio at the time this DM was sent on December 29, 2020, merely a week
                before January 6, and Pezzola was rather late to the party, joining the 
                <a href="https://sigsegv1980.github.io/j6/ProudBoys-MOSD-Main-2020-12-27_2021-1-4.pdf">MOSD MAIN Telegram chat group</a> as late as January 2,
                only 4 days before Jan 6 (see Government Exhibit <b>507-7</b>). Thus, the connection between Tarrio and Pezzola was
                somewhat tenuous. But since Pezzola happened to be one of the first rioters (or <i>the</i> first rioter) to breach the Capitol, the prosecution
                wanted to strengthen the connection between Pezzola's action and Tarrio's planning. The inclusion of this DM
                in the indictment is meant to strengthen the link between Pezzola and Tarrio, suggesting to the jury that when Pezzola 
                smashed the window and breached the Capitol, he was carrying out Tarrio's plans. Pezzola was ultimately
                the only Proud Boy acquitted of the seditious conspiracy charge.

                        times with an individual whose identity is known to the grand jury. On December 30,2020, this
                        individual sent TARRIO a nine-page document titled, “1776 Returns.” The document set forth a
                        plan to occupy a few “crucial buildings” in Washington, D.C., on January 6, including House and
                        Senate office buildings around the Capitol, with as “many people as possible” to “show our
                        politicians We the People are in charge.” After sending the document, the individual stated, “The
                        revolution is important than anything.” TARRIO responded, “That's what every waking moment
                        consists of ... I'm not playing games.”

                    of the MOSD. TARRIO, Donohoe, and others in MOSD leadership emphasized that members of
                    the MOSD were to follow the commands of leadership. Once again, TARRIO and others in MOSD
                    leadership advised prospective members that they could “fit in or fuck off.” REHL warned
                    prospective members that January 6 was going to be a “completely different operation” and that
                    the Proud Boys would not be conducting a “night march and flexing our [arms] and shit.”

                        <p>[Transcribed audio]: And just, just to throw this out there, like the uh, the dynamics for this entire DC rally are completely different, because the fact that 
                        we're, we're not going to be in colors, uh, one of the things I've been really hearing a lot about is like, oh my god, I'm hearing so much this about what's going 
                        on DC or that's going to possibly be going on in DC... Guys, look you gotta understand, we're going without colors, so, uh, a lot of, a lot of the fears and dynamics 
                        that people are thinking about are just complete bullshit and just ramble, I mean, and realistically like, I... every single rally I've done since like, like 2015, 
                        I've heard the same bullshit anyway, so I mean, it, it's, it's, it's just, it's just rumbles, and, and, and arguments.
                        <br><br>But like, um, while we're in DC and everything, I mean, it's not gonna be the same thing. We're not, we're not gonna be doing like, a Proud Bully 
                        fucking, um, you know, eight o'clock in early, uh, march, uh, and, and, and, and flexing our, flexing our guns, and shit. So you guys gotta understand that 
                        we're not doing that this time, you know, we're doing a completely different operation and there's, there's going to be a lot of uh... contingencies and, and 
                        plans laid out of what we're actually going to do and there's going to be teams, they're gonna be put together to, you know, um, you know, where they're gonna 
                        be going and what they're doing, so keep that in mind too, and like, when you tell your guys that kind of thing, um, you know, spread that word a little bit. 
                        I mean, don't, don't, don't spread it too far, but you know, spread it to the guys that you plan on bringing and everything, so that we, we can actually work 
                        together and, and, and make this make this DC event a little bit more successful.</p>
                        <br>
                        <p>Because this is, this, this is the training ground for um, you know, this entire operation and this whole, you know, this structure and everything, so 
                        we want to make it, we want to make it, you know, successful and um, you know, we we definitely are going to run into some problems uh, maybe maybe some 
                        errors, but we want to learn from those errors and then, and then work on those errors, so that we you know we don't make those errors again in the future 
                        at the next rally, so, yeah, I just wanted to throw that out there and uh...</p>

                The quoted fragments are an attempt to mislead the reader into believing that Rehl called Jan 6 a "<i>completely different operation</i>" because it
                was an operation that involved storming the Capitol.
                <br><br>
                But when read (or watched) in full, Rehl's rambling speech more or less summarizes the purpose of the MOSD chapter, which was
                to implement new rules and protocols that address logistical and disciplinary issues that arose during the previous D.C. rally in December. 
                These new protocols include breaking up into smaller groups (timestamp 16:59), not wearing identifying colors (timestamp 1:01:09), not getting drunk
                during rallies (4:40), and <b>always acting defensively instead of offensively</b> (timestamps 7:48, 32:03, 33:29).
                <br><br>
                These protocols were also meant to mitigate the difficulty of marching hundreds of people while maintaining formation, which was a major 
                source of frustration for Enrique Tarrio at the previous rally in December. Tarrio

                (see Government Exhibit <b>514-34</b>), because individual Proud Boys often lacked discipline while marching and broke formation after being provoked:

                Once again, the entire 1 hour and 38 minute December 30 MOSD Zoom call is <b>exculpatory evidence</b>. The Proud Boys talk for over an hour
                and a half, discussing the purpose of the MOSD chapter and new rallying strategies and safety measures, but 
                <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20220626172210/https://www.nytimes.com/2022/06/26/us/politics/proud-boys-jan-6.html">never once is there any mention of
                storming the Capitol</a> or really even doing anything illegal.
                <br><br>
                As the MOSD Zoom call was coming to an end, Zach Rehl said he wanted to <i><b>"make this DC event a little bit more successful"</b></i>. But what does the 
                prosecution think this even means? Does it mean that Rehl thinks storming the Capitol will "<i>make this DC event a little bit more successful</i>"? 
                Zach Rehl's rambling speech essentially just summarizes the goal of the MOSD chapter, which is to improve the way the Proud Boys conduct rallies. 
                Rehl suggests this will be an iterative process that will involve some mistakes, but over time, and after multiple future rallies, the Proud Boys 
                will eventually get it right. Nothing Rehl says here suggests any seditious plans to storm the Capitol:

                Included in the indictment because it shows Tarrio saying scary things which, while once again not
                constituting evidence of any actual specific plan to "revolt" or storm the Capitol, complements
                the earlier paragraph in the indictment about the "1776 Returns" document while also suggesting to the jury that Tarrio
                is probably the sort of person who <i>would</i> do something like storm a Capitol building.
                <br><br>
                Of course, Enrique Tarrio says lots of things. In fact, he posted a <i><b>particularly incriminating</b></i> message on
                Telegram, ominously foreshadowing the January 6 Capitol siege. In this post, a photograph shows Tarrio standing alone in front 
                of the US Capitol building. Underneath is a caption reading "<i><b>I'm home. #Soon</b></i>".<br>😨
                <br><br>

                <br><br>
                Seems pretty damning, right? Except, this post wasn't included in the indictment, because 
                <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20230523110559/https://t.me/MiamiProudBoys/176">Tarrio posted this back in November of 2019</a>. Clearly,
                Tarrio had no plan to "storm the Capitol" back in 2019, because Trump hadn't even lost the election at
                that point. No prosecutor could possibly argue Tarrio had any motive to storm the Capitol back in 2019.
                But then what do we make of this ominous Telegram post?
                <br><br>

                These Telegram posts were not included in the indictment, but they are relevant to the prosecution's argument that evidence of anti-police
                sentiment among the Proud Boys is also evidence that the Proud Boys conspired and planned in advance to attack police on Jan 6 as
                part of the plan to storm the Capitol. The prosecution also argued that Telegram and Parler posts exhibiting anti-police sentiment
                is evidence that all the preparations the Proud Boys made prior to Jan 6, such as bringing protective
                equipment (body armor) and walkie-talkies, was for the express purpose of attacking police, and <i>not</i> for the purpose of
                fighting with Antifa (as the Proud Boys' defense argued).

                Once again, there is no direct evidence the Proud Boys planned to attack police or storm the Capitol. All we have are
                examples of the Proud Boys occasionally saying mean things about the police. 
                <br><br>
                Historically, the Proud Boys have generally supported the police. Throughout the late 2010s as the <i>Black Lives Matter</i> movement 
                rose to prominence and police departments across the country faced significant vitriol from the public, the Proud Boys 
                remained mostly loyal to the cops, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20190712164344/https://twitter.com/FordFischer/status/1146920889096839171">proudly declaring that “Blue Lives Matter”</a>.

                This began to change in December of 2020, especially after a series of incidents that happened during the December 12, 2020 
                "Million MAGA March" rally in Washington DC. Firstly, four Proud Boys (including <b>Jeremy Bertino</b>) <a href="https://mpdc.dc.gov/release/arrest-made-assault-dangerous-weapon-knife-offense-500-block-11th-street-northwest">
                got stabbed during an altercation with a counter-protester</a> (whom the Proud Boys believed to be Antifa-affiliated) outside a D.C. bar. 
                <br><br>
                Secondly, Proud Boy chairman <b>Enrique Tarrio</b> decided to steal a <i>Black Lives Matter</i> banner that was hanging outside Asbury United Methodist Church, 
                an historic black church in D.C., and burn it publicly on the street. This incident was widely reported by the media and

                and media outlets as a hate crime</a>, despite the fact that Enrique Tarrio himself is black (Afro-Cuban).
                <br><br>
                Thirdly, as the Proud Boys marched around D.C. the night of December 12, they were <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20201214213718/https://www.washingtonpost.com/local/trump-dc-rally-maga/2020/12/11/8b5af818-3bdb-11eb-bc68-96af0daae728_story.html">often obstructed by police officers</a>

                that famously wants to defund police departments because #ACAB).
                <br><br>
                The cumulative effect of all this was that some Proud Boy leaders, like <b>Jeremy Bertino</b>, who was stabbed on December 12, 
                <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20201224234620/https://parler.com/profile/Noblebeard/posts">felt betrayed by the police</a> (or at least the DC police):

                Thus, throughout late December of 2020 and January of 2021, Proud Boy leadership became somewhat antagonistic towards the D.C. police, which explains
                the anti-police messages the Proud Boys posted on Telegram and Parler. The prosecution argues that the Proud Boys turned against the police because the Proud Boys wanted to storm the
                Capitol and therefore had to attack police. But the historical context here surrounding the Proud Boys and the
                December 12 rally <i><b>independently</b></i> explains <i>why</i> the Proud Boys suddenly turned against the police around mid-December
                of 2020.
                <br><br>
                Thus, Telegram or Parler posts from the Proud Boys that exhibit anti-police sentiment are <i>not</i> evidence of
                a plan to attack police and storm the Capitol. We know why the Proud Boys turned against the cops, and it had nothing
                to do with Jan 6.

                        about attacking the Capitol. One MOSD member—who had been hand-selected by Tarrio to join
                        the MOSD—wrote that it was “time to stack those bodies in front of Capitol Hill.” <b>One member

                        also asked, “what would they do [if] 1 million patriots stormed and took the capital [sic] building.
                        Shoot into the crowd? I think not.” A member of MOSD leadership responded that “[t]hey would

                This paragraph claims that on January 3, in the <b>MOSD MAIN</b> Telegram 
                group (called "MOSD Members" in the Civil Suit), the Proud Boys "<i>exchanged messages about attacking the Capitol</i>".
                This is <i><b>incredibly misleading</b></i> if not outright false, because it suggests the Proud Boys were having
                a conversation <i>about</i> storming the Capitol, which implies an ongoing discussion where participants hash out the
                details of a plan to storm the Capitol. But we can look for ourselves at the discussions in the
                <a href="https://sigsegv1980.github.io/j6/ProudBoys-MOSD-Main-2020-12-27_2021-1-4.pdf"><b>MOSD MAIN Telegram group</b></a>
                on January 3, 2021 (<a href="https://sigsegv1980.github.io/j6/ProudBoys-MOSD-MAIN-FullChatMessages-2020-12-27_2021-1-1.pdf">or other days</a>),
                and see that no such discussions exist. 
                <br><br>
                The <a href="https://sigsegv1980.github.io/j6/ProudBoys-MOSD-Main-2020-12-27_2021-1-4.pdf">full context</a> 
                reveals that <b>Jake Phillips'</b> post asking about storming the Capitol was a non-sequitur, and
                part of a discussion about a photo on social media showing the 1776 flag (an historical version of the US flag with 13 stars arranged in a circle) flying over 
                the White House (not the Capitol building). There was no discussion of any actual plans to storm the Capitol building. Also, 
                the post is from January 3, 2021, a mere <i>three days</i> before Jan 6, yet <b>Jake Phillips</b> asks about
                storming "<i>capitol buildings</i>" as if this was a new idea being raised here for the first time. Moreover, the post
                is a non-sequitur, not part of some ongoing discussion about attacking the Capitol. Nobody
                else ever engages with Jake Phillips' post and there are no replies or follow-up posts.
                <br><br>
                More significantly, <b>Jake Phillips</b> (who is one of the only two Proud Boys ever to even bring up the idea of
                "storming the Capitol" before Jan 6) <b>wasn't even in Washington D.C. on January 6 and never even planned to go there in the first
                place</b>. Instead, <a href="https://sigsegv1980.github.io/j6/JakePhillips-MessagesFromMOSDMain.html">Jake Phillips made plans to go to Columbus, Ohio on Jan 6,</a>
                to attend a <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20210107074637/https://www.dispatch.com/story/news/local/2021/01/06/tempers-were-short-fists-flew-street-during-trump-rally/6565956002/">local protest at the 
                State Capitol building</a> with his chapter of Ohio Proud Boys. Furthermore, <b>Jake Phillips</b> didn't really approve of the idea 
                of going to Washington DC on Jan 6. He <a href="https://sigsegv1980.github.io/j6/JakePhillips-MessagesFromMOSDMain.html">argued that local State Capitol protests were more effective 
                and easier to organize than a big rally in Washington DC, and he barely participated in the planning for Jan 6</a>.
                <br><br>
                So <b>Jake Phillips</b> was not in Washington DC on Jan 6, he never had plans to go there, he was not one of the
                upper-tier MOSD leaders, and he was never arrested or charged with anything. Thus, Jake Phillips' non-sequitur remarks 
                asking about storming capitols are mostly 
                irrelevant to the seditious conspiracy case. The prosecution selectively quoted <b>Jake Phillips</b>' Telegram post to create the illusion that
                his remarks were part of an ongoing discussion specifically <i>about</i> working out a plan to storm the Capitol. But no
                such discussion exists in any of the Telegram chat groups.

                This was included in the indictment because it's one of only four instances, out of thousands of Telegram posts
                recovered by the FBI, where any Proud Boy actually says the words "storm the Capitol" (or any similar phrase) prior to

                Included in the indictment because one Proud Boy, <b>John Charles Stewart (Johnny Blackbeard)</b>, mentions
                the Capitol building and recommends planning "<i>the operations base around the front entrance of the Capitol
                building</i>" and also recommends using the National Mall, because <i>"it's a wide open space, you can see
                everything coming from all angles."</i> This suggests to the jury that <b>Johnny Blackbeard's</b> comment is part of 
                a conversation where the Proud Boys were hashing out the logisitical details of their plan to storm the Capitol
                building. Again, the prosecution relies on the jury's natural <i>confirmation bias</i> to interpret any mention
                of the Capitol building or planning in general as evidence of a seditious conspiracy to storm the Capitol.
                <br><br>
                However, the full context reveals the Proud Boys were simply talking about <i>event planning</i>. <b>Johnny Blackbeard</b>'s
                statement about the Capitol building was in response to <b>Enrique Tarrio's</b> post, where he says <i>"I'm getting so many 
                conflicting issues with, like, stages, locations, and times that, um, that I don't know where to put people."</i> But why is
                Tarrio concerned with "like, stages locations, and times"? The reason Tarrio is concerned about these things is
                because the Proud Boys planned to attend the <a href="https://sigsegv1980.github.io/j6/Jan6MAGARallyMapGuideFull.pdf"><b>official events on Jan 6</b></a>, 
                because some Proud Boys were working
                security for these events, and <b>Enrique Tarrio</b> was very likely booked as a guest speaker on Jan 6 at the 
                <a href="https://sigsegv1980.github.io/j6/LatinosForTrumpJan6Flyer.pdf"><b>“Latinos for Trump” stage</b></a>
                at “Area 7” (300 First Street NE) by the Capitol between 10 AM and 12 PM. This is why <b>Zach Rehl</b> asks <i>"Is
                [Enrique Tarrio] still doing a speech? Where is that?"</i>
                <br><br>
                The Proud Boys often <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20201115132417/https://weartv.com/news/local/proud-boys-provide-security-at-pro-america-rally-in-milton">

                Tarrio also complained about "<i>conflicting issues</i>" with <i>"like, stages, locations, and times"</i>. Tarrio was getting "<i>conflicting

                (especially before it was publicly known
                that President Trump would be giving a speech at the Ellipse) because there were multiple

                <b>Enrique Tarrio</b> was very likely scheduled to give a speech on Jan 6 at the "Latinos for Trump" stage near the Capitol building. (See

                plus Zach Rehl asking about Tarrio's speech. Tarrio was 
                <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20201002154105/https://www.nytimes.com/2020/10/02/us/elections/the-florida-director-of-a-pro-trump-latino-group-is-the-chairman-of-the-proud-boys.html">
                Florida State director</a> of Latinos for Trump.)
                <br><br>
                Thus, since multiple Proud Boys, including <b>George "Asher" Mesa</b> and some Proud Boys from Tarrio's
                chapter, were scheduled to work security at the "Latinos for Trump" stage by the US Capitol on Jan 6, and Tarrio himself would
                likely be giving a speech there, <b>Johnny Blackbeard</b> recommended
                establishing "<i>the operations base</i>" by the Capitol building on the National Mall side. Obviously, the "<i>wide open space, [where] you can see everything 
                coming from all angles</i>" would make it easier for security personnel to detect threats from counter-protesters and secure the area around the stage.
                <br><br>
                Finally, <b>Johnny Blackbeard</b> was also worried about the DC Metropolitan Police potentially arresting Proud Boys on site, because of the
                <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20201213224106/https://www.nbcnews.com/news/us-news/black-lives-matter-signs-burned-d-c-churches-police-investigate-n1251050">

                Once again, the context surrounding these allegedly incriminating Telegram posts reveals that they have nothing to do with
                any seditious plan to storm the Capitol. They're about basic event planning.

                This Telegram post is one of the most important pieces of evidence for the prosecution's case.
                <b>Enrique Tarrio</b>, chairman of the Proud Boys, actually says the words "storm the Capitol". This is one of only 4 instances, across thousands of
                Telegram posts recovered by the FBI, where any Proud Boy actually says the words "storm the Capitol" (or any similar
                phrase), prior to January 6.
                <br><br>
                Except once again, this does not demonstrate any actual plan to storm the Capitol. It's a completely non-sequitur statement,
                just like the other times any Proud Boy said the words "storm the Capitol" on Telegram prior to Jan 6. There are no replies to this
                post and no follow-up discussion that we know about. Furthermore, <b>Enrique Tarrio</b> posted this on <i>January 4th</i>, a mere <i>two days</i> before Jan 6.
                If the prosecution's seditious conspiracy case had any merit, any plans to storm the Capitol should have been nearly finalized by January 4th, and should 
                have dominated the discussions in the MOSD Telegram group. Instead, all we have are a handful of isolated, non-sequitur comments like this, 
                with no specific details.
                <br><br>
                It's possible Tarrio was simply joking. It's also possible Tarrio was actually seriously considering trying to storm the Capitol.
                The Proud Boys certainly approved and celebrated when hundreds of Trump supporters breached the Capitol on
                Jan 6. But there's simply no evidence that the Proud Boys actually <i>made plans in advance of Jan 6</i> to storm the Capitol.
                <br><br>
                But why would Tarrio joke about storming the Capitol, or even bring up such an idea, if the Proud Boys weren't already planning
                on storming the Capitol, or at least considering such a plan? Well, <b>Enrique Tarrio</b> doesn't exist in a vacuum. The idea of 
                "storming the Capitol" was very popular with the online MAGA-sphere at the time. From November 2020 through January 5, 2021, there
                were around <a href="https://sigsegv1980.github.io/j6/ZenodoParlerPostsFromNovember2020ToJanuary2021WithKeywordStormTheCapitol_IncludingEchoes.html">
                <b>468 Parler posts</b> (including echoes) exhorting Trump supporters to <b>storm Capitol buildings</b></a> or other administrative centers, 
                averaging around <b>40,943</b> daily views. This includes calls to storm both State Capitol buildings and the US Capitol building
                in DC. 
                <br><br>
                In fact, "storming the Capitol building" doesn't even necessarily refer to an illegal act. It can sometimes
                mean something like "occupy the Capitol". In November, 2020, in Atlanta, Georgia, Alex Jones <i><b>legally</b></i> led a contingent 
                of Trump supporters inside the Georgia State Capitol building, where they stood around with signs and chanted slogans before leaving 
                peacefully. Yet <i>The Gateway Pundit</i> reported that Jones led a <a href="https://www.thegatewaypundit.com/2020/11/happening-now-alex-jones-leading-crowd-trump-supporters-storming-georgia-state-capitol-video/">
                “<i><b>Crowd of Trump Supporters Storming [the] Georgia State Capitol</b></i>”</a>.
                Some journalists on Twitter also referred to this completely legal demonstration as 
                <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20201118174048/https://twitter.com/BGOnTheScene/status/1329116419037024273">"<b><i>storm[ing] the Capitol</i></b>"</a> as well.
                <br><br>
                Clearly, the phrase "storm the Capitol" was sometimes used in the sense of "occupy the Capitol", i.e. a form of
                legitimate political protest. The phrase "occupy the Capitol", or some variation of it, appeared
                <a href="https://sigsegv1980.github.io/j6/ParlerPostsUsingOccupyLikeProgressives_2020_IncludingEchoes.html">on Parler around <b>3,450</b>
                times</a> from November 2020 through January 5, 2021. The concept of "storming" or "occupying" Capitol buildings was simply
                a prevalent feature of the zeitgeist surrounding the "Stop the Steal" or MAGA movement in late 2020. 
                <br><br>
                But even if Tarrio wasn't joking, there's no evidence the Proud Boys drew up any formal plans to storm the Capitol. In fact, there's
                actually direct evidence to the contrary. On January 2, 2021, just 2 days before Tarrio posted this voice message on Telegram, Tarrio posted 
                <a href="https://sigsegv1980.github.io/j6/ProudBoys-MOSDChat-2020-12-20_2021-1-4.pdf">another voice message
                in the MOSD chat (Government Exhibit 501-53)</a>, in response to a Tweet someone posted accusing the Proud Boys of 
                planning to break into Federal buildings on January 6th. <b>Enrique Tarrio</b>
                then began posting jokes about this, including a self-deprecating joke lamenting that the Proud Boys could <i>barely</i> even march in formation 
                correctly, and were therefore not even remotely capable of doing something as cool as storming a Federal building:

                        On January 4, 2021, within one hour of TARRIO's arrest pursuant to a warrant issued by D.C.  Superior Court, Donohoe created a new group on the

                        At 7:39 p.m., PERSON-1 sent two text messages to TARRIO that read, “Brother.
                        You know we made this happen[,]” and “I'm so proud of my country today.” TARRIO responded,
                        “I know.” At 7:44 p.m., the conversation continued, with PERSON-1 texting, “1776
                        motherfuckers.” TARRIO responded, “The Winter Palace.” PERSON-1 texted, “Dude. Did we
                        just influence history?” TARRIO responded, “Let's first see how this plays out.” PERSON-1
                        stated, “They HAVE to certify today! Or it's invalid.” These messages were exchanged before
                        the Senate returned to its chamber at approximately 8:00 p.m. to resume certifying the Electoral
                        College vote.

                        25% of the way in. That fucking building
                        should still be occupied right now. They
                        should have cops stuck inside that building.
                        They should– they took it. They were there,
                        they were in. But instead they decided to
                        run around and take a bunch of fucking
                        selifes. And, you know, steal some
                        memorabilia to prove that they were in
                        there so that their conviction is assured.

                        Because it’s clear to me at this
                        point, the American people, the, you know,
                        air-quotes “patriots,” they’re looking for
                        somebody to save them still. They want us
                        to do it for them. And Proud Boys can’t bear
                        this burden. It’s too big for us alone. We
                        needed them to step up, and all they gave
                        us was 25% of a measure. And now they’re
                        all back home and, uh, yesterday’s events
                        are gonna be used to smash us in ways we
                        couldn’t even imagine. It’s just-- I don’t
                        even know, man. At this point I’m getting
                        ready to get together with my guys and talk
                        about how we’re gonna proceed when all of
                        this shit comes down. Because it is coming
                        down.
