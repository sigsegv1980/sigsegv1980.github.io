The injuries to Officer T.S.’s foot required multiple surgeries  ... </p><p> </p><p>As discussed above, as a result of Hazard’s assault, Officer T.S. sustained extensive,  severe, and prolonged injuries, the effects of which he still experiences today. These injuries were  of such a caliber that the parties agreed that a 6-point offense level enhancement pursuant to  U.S.S.G. § 2A2.2(b)(3)(E)11 should apply. While many police officers and other individuals  were injured as a result of the events of January 6, 2021, the Government has identified only three  other cases in which it sought a 5 or more level enhancement pursuant to U.S.S.G. § 2A2.2(b)(3). </p></td><td style="text-align:left;width:208.06pt; " class="Default"><p><a href="https://sigsegv1980.github.io/j6/2023-05-11-USAvDonaldHazard-GovernmentsSentencingMemorandum.pdf">Donald Hazard Sentencing Memo</a></p></td></tr>
