        <h2>Background</h2>
        <br>
        5 members of the <b>Proud Boys</b> were 
        <a href="https://sigsegv1980.github.io/j6/2022-06-06-USAvEthanNordeanAndJosephBiggsAndZacharyRehlAndEnriqueTarrioAndDominicPezzola-ThirdSupersedingIndictment.pdf">
        charged with <b>seditious conspiracy</b></a> for their role in the January 6, 2021 attack on the US Capitol building. 
        Prosecutors claimed that <b>Enrique Tarrio</b>, the leader and chairman of the Proud Boys at the time, conspired
        with <b>Ethan Nordean</b>, <b>Joseph Biggs</b>, <b>Zachary Rehl</b>, and <b>Dominic Pezzola</b>, to storm the
        US Capitol building for the purpose of overturning the 2020 election results, by riling up a large crowd of "normie"
        pro-Trump protesters and using them as a battering ram to breach police defensive lines and occupy the Capitol
        building. The defense acknowledged that some <b>Proud Boys</b> participated in the Capitol riot on January 6, but denied 
        that the defendants actually <i>planned</i> in advance of January 6 to storm the Capitol.
        <br><br>
        The evidence presented by the prosecution to support the <b>seditious conspiracy</b> charges included video footage from January 6, 
        but focused primarily around online activity (mostly Telegram and Parler posts) demonstrating that the Proud Boys made statements 
        that could be interpreted as incriminating evidence of planning in advance to storm the Capitol. The prosecution filed 
        <a href="https://sigsegv1980.github.io/j6/2022-06-06-USAvEthanNordeanAndJosephBiggsAndZacharyRehlAndEnriqueTarrioAndDominicPezzola-ThirdSupersedingIndictment.pdf">
        <b>an indictment</b></a>
        against the 5 Proud Boy conspirators that listed incriminating Telegram and Parler messages in support of the <b>seditious conspiracy</b>
        charges. All of the defendants, except <b>Dominic Pezzola</b>, were found guilty of <b>seditious conspiracy</b> and 
        <a href="https://sigsegv1980.github.io/j6/2023-09-15-USAvEnriqueTarrio-Judgment.pdf">sentenced to at least 15 years</a>
        in prison. I review all of the <a href="https://sigsegv1980.github.io/j6/ProudBoys-IncriminatingChats.html">
        <b>incriminating Telegram and Parler evidence</b></a> in a companion piece to this webpage.
        <br><br>
        I take the position that the <b>seditious conspiracy</b> charges were <b><i>largely baseless</i></b>, and <b>all 5 defendants should
        have been acquitted</b> of that charge due to reasonable doubt.  There is no doubt that some <b>Proud Boys</b> participated in the Capitol riot on 
        January 6 and <i>enthusiastically</i> supported and praised the Jan 6 rioters. But the prosecution's evidence that the Proud Boys actually planned in 
        advance to storm the Capitol is <a href="https://sigsegv1980.github.io/j6/ProudBoys-IncriminatingChats.html">
        incredibly weak and unconvincing</a>. Additionally, there is a large body of <b>exculpatory evidence</b> 
        (evidence suggesting a <b>not guilty</b> verdict)
        found among the Telegram and Parler data in evidence. Here, I go over the most compelling examples of such <b>exculpatory evidence</b>.
        Most of the relevant evidence is available publicly. I have provided a convenient summary of the available sources of trial evidence, and 
        I encourage readers to examine the raw trial evidence and reach their own conclusions.

        <h2>Sources Of Evidence (so you can reach your own conclusion)</h2>
        <br>
        The trial evidence mostly centered around Telegram and Parler messages from the defendants, particularly the Telegram messages
        from private group chats affiliated with a chapter of the <b>Proud Boys</b> called <b><i>“The Ministry of Self Defense” (MOSD)</b></i>. As an organization,
        the <b>Proud Boys</b> (<a href="https://sigsegv1980.github.io/j6/ProudBoysConstitutionAndBylaws.pdf">Proud Boys International, L.L.C.</a>)
        were divided into several <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20201126161545/https://proudboysusa.com/chapters/">autonomous regional chapters</a>, 
        loosely governed by Chairman <b>Enrique Tarrio</b> and a council of “Elders”. In December of 2020,
        <b>Enrique Tarrio</b> created <b>“The Ministry of Self Defense”</b> as a new, <i>national-level</i> chapter 
        for organizing national events. The prosecution argued that <b>Tarrio</b> established the <b>MOSD</b> chapter specifically for the purpose
        of planning the January 6 insurrection. Therefore, the majority of the prosecution's
        evidence consists of messages pulled from multiple private Telegram chat groups affiliated with the <b>MOSD</b> chapter of the Proud Boys.
        <br><br>
        Most of the relevant evidence is available publicly. Some of it can be found in
        the <b>Government Exhibits</b> filed electronically with <a href="https://pacer.uscourts.gov/"><b>PACER</b></a>, which I have organized into  
        separate PDF files for each Telegram group (linked below). The
        Telegram evidence from Government Exhibits usually consists of excerpts selected by the prosecution that omit most of the surrounding context.
        Fortunately, we also have a more complete record of some Telegram groups thanks to 
        <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20220827161137/https://t.me/helpstophate/5468"><b><i>leaked documents</i></b></a> (authenticated

        Telegram chat history recovered by the FBI using forensic software called <a href="https://cellebrite.com/en/home/"><b>Cellebrite</b></a>. Finally, 
        I have also personally recovered

        The analysis is organized in a 3 column layout. The <b>left-most</b> column shows the

        and links to the source of the evidence.
        The <b>right column</b> analyzes the quoted Telegram/Parler evidence and explains why it is <b>exculpatory</b>.

                As an organization, the <b>Proud Boys</b> (<a href="https://sigsegv1980.github.io/j6/ProudBoysConstitutionAndBylaws.pdf">Proud Boys International, L.L.C.</a>) 
                are divided into several semi-autonomous regional chapters, 
                loosely governed by a Chairman and a council of “Elders”. On December 20th, 2020, Chairman <b>Enrique Tarrio</b> created a new
                national-level chapter called <b>“The Ministry of Self Defense”</b> (<b>MOSD</b>), along with several private Telegram group chats
                associated with the new chapter. Tarrio invited many high-ranking Proud Boys to join (herein referred to as the “<b>MOSD Proud Boys</b>”)
                including <b>Joe Biggs</b>, <b>Ethan Nordean</b>, <b>Zach Rehl</b>, and <b>John Charles Stewart</b> (a.k.a. “<b>Johnny Blackbeard</b>”). 
                <br><br>
                Initially, <b>Enrique Tarrio</b> provided a rather terse mission statement for the <b>MOSD</b> chapter:
                <i>“<a href="https://sigsegv1980.github.io/j6/ProudBoys-SkullAndBonesChat-2020-9-29_2021-1-4.pdf#page=11"><b>to standardize event organizing</b></a>”</i>.
                Other <b>MOSD</b> Proud Boys ascribed similar purposes to the <b>MOSD</b> chapter, including
                <i>“<a href="https://sigsegv1980.github.io/j6/ProudBoys-MOSD-MAIN-FullChatMessages-2020-12-27_2021-1-1.pdf#page=279"><b>a structure to make events better</b></a>”</i>
                and 
                <i>“<a href="https://sigsegv1980.github.io/j6/ProudBoys-MOSDProspectsSmall.pdf"><b>a 
                professional business only chapter for organizing and running security for national events</b></a>”</i> (Govt Exhibit <b>513-1</b>).
                In contrast, during the conspiracy trial,
                the prosecution claimed that the <b>MOSD</b> chapter was created for the <i>specific</i> purpose of
                planning an attack on the US Capitol to be carried out on January 6th, 2021.
                <br><br>
                In the Telegram conversation quoted in the left column, <b>John Charles Stewart</b> (a.k.a. <b>Johnny Blackbeard</b>) 
                asks <b>Enrique Tarrio</b>
                if the <b>MOSD</b> Proud Boys will be traveling to Washington DC as a group on January 6, 2021. <b>Johnny Blackbeard</b> alludes to 
                something he expects to happen on 
                January 6 that he calls <b><i>“the after party”</i></b>. The prosecution
                would probably interpret <b><i>“the after party”</i></b> as a veiled allusion to a secret plan to storm the Capitol.

                (herein referred to using the umbrella term <b>“Antifa”</b>). The Proud Boys had good reasons to expect
                violent conflict with <b>Antifa</b> on January 6, because this is exactly what happened during the two previous

                Shortly before January 6, both the

                released intelligence briefings that predicted there would be violent clashes between the Proud Boys and counter-protester groups in the 
                streets of DC on January 6th, just as there was during earlier D.C. MAGA rallies in November and December of 2020.
                The <b>US Park Police</b> released a similar 
                <a href="https://sigsegv1980.github.io/j6/2020-12-28-UnitedStatesParkPoliceExecutiveBrief-6January2021-WMADemonstrationsActivity.pdf"><b>intelligence briefing</b></a> 
                predicting <b>late night street battles</b> between the <b>Proud Boys</b> and <b>Antifa</b> in Washington DC on January 6, 2021, warning that 
                <i>“we should expect an event similar to those that occurred on 14 November 2020
                and 12 December 2020 in Washington, DC”</i> and that <i>“we do anticipate street-level confrontation/violence 
                between [the Proud Boys and counter-protesters]”</i>.
                An earlier intelligence briefing from the <b>US Park Police</b> had correctly predicted that 
                <a href="https://sigsegv1980.github.io/j6/USParkPoliceEventPreBrief-DCProtestsOn9December2020-MillionMAGAMarch-ProudBoysvAntifa.pdf">violent 
                street fighting would break out during the December 12th rally</a>, warning that the Proud Boys were likely to clash
                with a <i>“radical group ... made up of individuals who self-identify with the <b>Antifa</b> identity”</i>,
                and that <b><i>“it is almost a certainty that violent confrontations will occur between members of opposing groups”</i></b>.

                This prognosis is almost certainly what the <b>Proud Boys</b> themselves

                clash violently with <b>Antifa</b> counter-protesters</a>
                in the streets. <b>Johnny Blackbeard</b>'s reference to an anticipated <b><i>“after party”</i></b> also highlights the fact that the <b>Proud Boys</b> were 
                focused primarily on

                on January 6, rather than some secret plot to storm the Capitol. This is consistent with a

                <br><br>
                Thus, the fact that <b>Johnny Blackbeard</b>'s conception of the upcoming Jan 6 rally entailed a <i>“<b>protest portion</b>”</i>
                followed by an <i>“<b>after party</b>”</i>, <i>strongly</i> suggests that at the time of these Telegram posts on December 20th, 2020,
                the <b>MOSD</b> Proud Boys had no knowledge whatsoever of any plan to storm the Capitol, and instead seemed to be operating under
                the assumption that the January 6 rally 
                would play out similarly to previous D.C. MAGA rallies.

                Of course, the prosecution maintained that <b>Enrique Tarrio</b> created the <b>“Ministry Of Self Defense”</b> (<b>MOSD</b>) chapter for the 
                specific purpose of planning the Jan 6 insurrection. 
                But <b>Enrique Tarrio's</b> response to <b>Johnny Blackbeard</b> (quoted in the left column) where he said
                <i>“<b>... let’s get this shit started so we can get a test run in</b>”</i> 
                is an important clue that helps us tease out the <i>ACTUAL</i> purpose of the <b>MOSD</b> chapter as well

                <b>Enrique Tarrio</b> did further elaborate on the purpose of the <b>MOSD</b> chapter. Tarrio explained that the <b>MOSD</b> 
                was established to prevent aggressive or insubordinate
                behavior from “rank-and-file” Proud Boys at national events, and to make it easier for the Proud Boy leadership to control and direct 
                large numbers of Proud Boys while marching in formation:

                over an hour and thirty minutes (see

                in detail the organizational
                structure and purpose of the newly established “<b>Ministry Of Self Defense</b>” (<b>MOSD</b>) chapter.
                Tarrio explained that  
                the <b>MOSD</b> chapter had a stricter command structure intended to ensure that individual Proud Boys do not break formation
                or behave insubordinately during official marches. The <b>MOSD</b> chapter also instituted new rallying policies 
                such as <a href="https://youtu.be/9HY3IVStIJc?t=1019">splitting up into smaller <b>10 man  
                squads</b></a>, <a href="https://youtu.be/9HY3IVStIJc?t=3668">forbidding official Proud Boy colors</a>, 
                <a href="https://youtu.be/9HY3IVStIJc?t=273">disallowing intoxication or drug use</a>, 
                and acting <b><i>defensively</i></b> at all times (timestamps

                <br><br>
                These new policies were
                designed to address disciplinary issues that came up earlier on December 12th, 2020, during the second

                The new <b>MOSD</b> chapter was designed to address these disciplinary and organizational issues while also making it easier for
                leadership to control and direct large numbers of Proud Boys during official marches. This had proven 
                <a href="https://youtu.be/9HY3IVStIJc?t=4858">very
                difficult to do at earlier rallies</a>, and the reason for splitting up into ten man squads was, as <b>MOSD</b> leader
                <b>Johnny Blackbeard</b> explained, because <i>“<a href="https://youtu.be/9HY3IVStIJc?t=4840"><b>it's easier to herd ten cats than a hundred</b></a>”</i>.
                <br><br>
                <b>Enrique Tarrio</b> also clearly explained the purpose of attending the January 6 rally in DC: he wanted
                to use the Jan 6 rally as an opportunity to <b><i>field test</i></b> the new <b>MOSD</b> command structure and rallying policies. For example, in the 
                <a href="https://sigsegv1980.github.io/j6/ProudBoys-MOSD-MAIN-FullChatMessages-2020-12-27_2021-1-1.pdf#page=194"><b>MOSD Main Telegram group chat</b></a>, Tarrio
                stated <b><i>“we are going to be using the 6th as a test”</i></b> and explained that the <b>MOSD</b> chapter would be
                running <i><b>“training exercises”</b></i> during <a href="https://sigsegv1980.github.io/j6/ProudBoys-MOSD-MAIN-FullChatMessages-2020-12-27_2021-1-1.pdf#page=118">
                <i>“the 5th at night and 6th throughout the day”</i></a>.
                This is consistent with <b>Tarrio's</b> comments
                during the <b>MOSD Zoom meeting</b> (timestamp <a href="https://youtu.be/9HY3IVStIJc?t=1051"><b>17:31</b></a>)
                elaborating on the new policy of splitting up into smaller 10-man squads and summarizing the actual
                plan for January 6th: <i>“<b>As of right now, the plans for the sixth is just to remain as a nucleus</b>”</i>. 
                Essentially, <b>Tarrio</b> wanted to use the Jan 6 rally as an opportunity to <b>test drive the new MOSD</b> chapter by trying to navigate the 
                streets of DC as a cohesive, disciplined, well-oiled infantry, subdivided into 10 man squads orbiting a single <i>“<b>nucleus</b>”</i>:

                </div>
                When we synthesize <b>Enrique Tarrio's</b> various statements about “<b><i>remaining as a nucleus</i></b>” and 
                staying <b><i>“as one fucking unit”</i></b> with his other statements describing the agenda for January 6th
                <i>“<a href="https://sigsegv1980.github.io/j6/ProudBoys-MOSD-MAIN-FullChatMessages-2020-12-27_2021-1-1.pdf#page=194"><b>as a test</b></a>”</i>
                involving <i>“<a href="https://sigsegv1980.github.io/j6/ProudBoys-MOSD-MAIN-FullChatMessages-2020-12-27_2021-1-1.pdf#page=118"><b>training exercises</b></a>”</i>,
                Tarrio's <i><b>TRUE</b></i>
                plans for January 6th become pretty clear. Again, <b>Tarrio</b> basically wanted to use the January 6 rally 
                to <b><i>field test</i></b> a march with the <b>MOSD</b> Proud Boys through the streets of DC. The objective was to
                divide the attending <b>MOSD</b> Proud Boys into ten-man squads while maintaining 
                a single overall marching formation (<b><i>“stay as one fucking unit”</i></b> and <b><i>“remain as a nucleus”</i></b>). The stricter
                <b>MOSD</b> command structure and rallying policies (e.g. <a href="https://youtu.be/9HY3IVStIJc?t=273">banning alcohol</a>) were intended to help leadership
                coordinate the ten-man squads while maintaining a single overall formation like a well-disciplined and unified infantry.
                <br><br>
                This is why when <b>Johnny Blackbeard</b> asked <b>Enrique Tarrio</b> if the Proud Boys would be attending the rally
                on January 6 <i>“as a group”</i>, <b>Tarrio</b> responded affirmatively, and then added <i>“So let’s get this shit started <b>so we 
                can get a test run in</b>”</i>. Again, the Telegram evidence demonstrates pretty conclusively that <b>Enrique Tarrio</b> viewed January 6 primarily 
                as an opportunity to 
                <a href="https://sigsegv1980.github.io/j6/ProudBoys-MOSD-MAIN-FullChatMessages-2020-12-27_2021-1-1.pdf#194"><b>field test</b></a> 
                the new <b>MOSD</b> command structure and rallying policies. <b>Tarrio</b>'s long-term vision for the new <b>MOSD</b> chapter was that eventually
                it would enable Proud Boy leadership to control and direct <i>one thousand or more</i> Proud Boys in a public march while maintaining formation
                and ensuring discipline among the “rank and file”.

                Of course, none of this has <i>anything</i> to do with a secret <i><b>seditious conspiracy</b></i> 
                to attack the Capitol. Throughout the entire hour and thirty-eight minute 
                <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9HY3IVStIJc"><b>MOSD Zoom conference</b></a>,
                wherein high-ranking <b>MOSD</b> leaders discuss plans for the new chapter in detail, there is not a <i>single</i>
                mention of anything remotely resembling a plan or conspiracy to storm the Capitol building. Furthermore,
                the prosecution's claim that the <b>MOSD</b> chapter was created specifically to plan
                an insurrection is refuted by the large body of Telegram evidence where the purpose of the <b>MOSD</b> chapter and
                the agenda for January 6th are clearly explained.
                <br><br>
                Finally, <b>Enrique Tarrio</b>
                had long-term plans and ambitions for the “<b>Ministry Of Self Defense</b>” chapter that went well
                beyond January 6th. He clearly exhibited a keen interest in slowly 
                and painstakingly growing the <b>MOSD</b>
                chapter over time until it eventually becomes a well-disciplined infantry with <i>one thousand or more</i> members. 
                This sort of sober, long-term planning
                and rational goal setting really doesn't leave much room for anything so acutely life-changing or disruptive as 
                a secret plan to storm the US Capitol building on January 6th. It is very likely that no such secret plan ever actually existed.

                This is one of several Telegram conversations demonstrating that the Proud Boys were quite concerned
                about the possibility of getting stabbed on January 6th, and clearly express an interest

                The fact that many high-ranking <b>MOSD</b> leaders seemed to genuinely fear getting stabbed on January 6th 
                strongly suggests they assumed further violent conflict with <b>Antifa</b> on January 6th was highly probable. 
                If the Proud
                Boys were operating under the assumption that January 6th would play out similarly to previous MAGA rallies in D.C. (e.g. 
                the <b>“Million MAGA March”</b> rallies on 
                <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20201118012633/https://www.washingtonpost.com/dc-md-va/2020/11/14/million-maga-march-dc-protests/">November 14th</a> 
                and <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20201213045338/https://www.nbcwashington.com/news/local/trump-supporters-maga-rally-protest-dc-saturday/2506267/">December 12th
                of 2020</a>), then of course the Proud Boys would have expected their primary antagonist on Jan 6 to be <b>Antifa</b> (or other counter-protester groups). 
                Yet the prosecution repeatedly
                argued that the Proud Boys were <i>not</i>, in fact, worried about confronting <b>Antifa</b> on January 6th, but rather
                were primarily focused on attacking the D.C. police and storming the Capitol:

                    <div class="inner-blurb">
                        As laid bare by the defendants’ own words before and on January 6, the defendants’
                        preparation for conflict was not focused on Antifa — it was the preparation for conflict with law
                        enforcement and government officials who they had declared traitors.
                    </div>
                </div>
                To say that any of the <b>MOSD</b> Proud Boys were <i>“not focused on Antifa”</i> is a <b>brazen</b> lie that contradicts the
                vast amount of Telegram evidence wherein the Proud Boys discussed <a href="https://sigsegv1980.github.io/j6/ProudBoys-MOSD-MAIN-FullChatMessages-2020-12-27_2021-1-1.pdf#page=109">

                as well as <a href="https://sigsegv1980.github.io/j6/ProudBoys-ExportedTelegramChatMOSDOp/messages.html#go_to_message386">disguises to blend in with <b>Antifa</b></a>
                on January 6th. And on the morning of Jan 6 itself, shortly before the Capitol riot began, the Proud Boys 
                <a href="https://youtu.be/oSOsG5kN5wc?t=773">were marching around
                the streets of D.C. while chanting <b><i>“Fuck Antifa!”</i></b></a> — a 
                <a href="https://x.com/BGOnTheScene/status/1346645650147049476">popular Proud Boy chant</a> heard at 
                <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20201119003724/https://video.parler.com/Vw/KV/VwKViYWJTxob_small.mp4">many rallies</a>.
                The prosecution ignored <i>all of that</i>, and instead called attention to a few instances where
                a Proud Boy expressed anti-police sentiment, such as the January 5th Telegram post from <b>Aaron Wolkind</b> saying that 
                <a href="https://sigsegv1980.github.io/j6/ProudBoys-IncriminatingChats.html#anc33"><i>“cops are the primary threat”</i></a>. 
                But this single post from <b>Aaron Wolkind</b> — intended to address very 
                <a href="https://sigsegv1980.github.io/j6/ProudBoys-IncriminatingChats.html#anc33">specific circumstances</a> — is far outweighed
                by other Telegram evidence, including
                <a href="https://sigsegv1980.github.io/j6/ProudBoys-ExportedTelegramChatMOSDOp/messages.html"><i>entire conversations</i></a>, 
                spread across multiple days, where various <b>MOSD</b> Proud Boys (including upper-tier leaders like 
                <a href="https://sigsegv1980.github.io/j6/ProudBoys-ExportedTelegramChatMOSDOp/messages.html#go_to_message163"><b>Joe Biggs</b></a>
                and <a href="https://sigsegv1980.github.io/j6/ProudBoys-ExportedTelegramChatMOSDOp/messages.html#go_to_message432"><b>Enrique Tarrio</b></a>) 
                make it <i>absolutely clear</i> that <b>Antifa</b> is the primary topic of conversation and source of concern
                driving preparations for the January 6th rally.
                <br><br>
                In particular, the prosecution failed to account for the
                fact that the Proud Boys repeatedly discussed <b><i>stab proof</i></b> body armor on Telegram in preparation for the Jan 6 rally. 
                The D.C. police do not regularly use knives and generally don't stab people, so all those discussions about relatively expensive <b>stab-proof body armor</b>
                make little sense if the Proud Boys were primarily interested in attacking the cops. But <b>Antifa</b>
                <a href="https://sigsegv1980.github.io/j6/2020-07-05-USAvChristopherFellini.pdf#page=8">does occasionally use knives</a>,
                and multiple Proud Boys were

                (whom <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20210110204254/https://rumble.com/vcbz9d-rebel-talk-episode-2.html">Proud Boy leadership believed was affiliated</a> with 
                <b>Antifa</b>)
                during the previous D.C. rally in December of 2020. 
                Furthermore, Telegram posts from

                point out that the Proud Boys would need to hide their beards in order to successfully conceal their presence from

                This makes it definitively clear that the Proud Boys' preparations in advance of January 6th — including the use of protective equipment
                and <a href="https://sigsegv1980.github.io/j6/ProudBoys-ExportedTelegramChatMOSDOp/messages.html#go_to_message386">donning <b>Antifa</b>-style “black bloc” disguises</a> 
                — were primarily made <i>specifically</i> in anticipation of violent conflict with <b>Antifa</b> 
                <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yOeMrBGS1n8">after dark</a>, and had
                nothing to do with attacking cops or storming Capitols.
                <br><br>
                Of course, while the Proud Boys were primarily concerned with <b>Antifa</b> on January 6th, they were 
                also certainly quite <i>wary</i> of the D.C. police as well. Some Proud Boy leaders grew 
                <a href="https://apnews.com/article/biden-politics-proud-boys-donald-trump-washington-b6f19086dd983c9a653ab83043c5523f">particularly distrustful</a> of the cops in D.C.</a>
                after the <b>US Park Police</b> (who were 
                <a href="https://sigsegv1980.github.io/j6/USParkPoliceEventPreBrief-DCProtestsOn9December2020-MillionMAGAMarch-ProudBoysvAntifa.pdf">tasked with keeping
                the Proud Boys physically separated from counter-protester groups</a>) actively
                <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20201214213718/https://www.washingtonpost.com/local/trump-dc-rally-maga/2020/12/11/8b5af818-3bdb-11eb-bc68-96af0daae728_story.html">
                obstructed the Proud Boys
                during the December 12th rally</a> in order to prevent street fighting with counter-protesters.
                Nonetheless, the Telegram evidence (especially the <a href="https://sigsegv1980.github.io/j6/ProudBoys-ExportedTelegramChatMOSDOp/messages.html">
                conversations in <b>MOSD Ops</b></a>) 
                makes it <i>abundantly</i> clear that the Proud Boys
                viewed <b>Antifa</b> (<i>not</i> the police) as their primary antagonist on January 6th, and
                <a href="https://sigsegv1980.github.io/j6/ProudBoys-ExportedTelegramChatMOSDOp/messages.html#go_to_message386">prepared accordingly</a>.
                <br><br>
                Finally, it should be noted that the Proud Boys' expectation of <b>Antifa</b>-related violence was shared by
                Federal law enforcement and intelligence agencies. Indeed, a 
                <a href="https://sigsegv1980.github.io/j6/2021-01-04-DHSIntelligenceInDepth-DiverseDomesticViolentExtremistLandscapeProbablyWillPersistDueToEnduringGrievances.pdf">
                <b>DHS/FBI intelligence briefing</b></a> released two days before Jan 6 warned that <i>“<b>anarchist violent extremists</b>
                likely will continue to pose a threat of
                violence — much of which will be non-lethal — against law enforcement, individuals, and
                institutions they view as symbols of authority, capitalism, and perceived oppression,
                particularly those believed to be racist or fascist.”</i> Furthermore, a

                intelligence brief released by the <b>US Capitol Police</b></a>,
                all predicted that there would be violent clashes between the Proud Boys and counter-protester groups in the streets of Washington D.C. on January 6th,
                just as there was during the previous two D.C. MAGA rallies in 
                <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20201118012633/https://www.washingtonpost.com/dc-md-va/2020/11/14/million-maga-march-dc-protests/">November</a>

                Thus, the Proud Boys' expectation of violent conflict with
                <b>Antifa</b> on Jan 6  
                was in fact shared by the 
                <b>Department of Homeland Security</b>, the <b>FBI</b>, the <b>Secret Service</b>, the <b>US Capitol Police</b>, <i>and</i> the <b>US Park Police</b>, due to the 
                violence observed during clashes with counter-protesters
                at earlier MAGA rallies throughout 2020. (The umbrella term <b>“Antifa”</b> overlaps with the <b>DHS/FBI</b> concept of

                intelligence briefing</b></a> 
                described <b>Antifa</b> as a <i>“radical”</i> subset of counter-protesters <i>“where historically
                the most violent action originates”</i>, and that <b>Antifa</b>-affiliated individuals <b><i>“are believed to have been the

                to expect more violent conflict with <b>Antifa</b> on January 6th, and most of the Proud Boys' preparations
                for the rally were made with this conflict in mind.

                the newly established <b>MOSD</b> chapter in a private Telegram chat group for Proud Boy “elders”. Tarrio explained that
                the purpose of the <b>MOSD</b> was to <i>“discourage and remove new fags and aggressive members
                from attending national events”</i>. (The phrase <i>“new fags”</i> is not a slur, but rather a term carried over from
                4chan jargon meaning an inexperienced individual who is new to the sub-culture.) <b>Tarrio</b> justified the creation of the <b>MOSD</b> chapter 
                as the <i>“best compromise we can come up with to hold unruly members accountable at [national] events”.</i>
                <br><br>
                <b>Tarrio's</b> claim is consistent with other instances when Proud Boy leaders
                explained the purpose of the <b>MOSD</b> chapter, such as <b>Charles Donohoe</b>'s

                Thus, multiple high-ranking Proud Boy leaders <i>clearly</i> spelled out — on multiple occasions — the exact purpose of the <b>MOSD</b> chapter: 
                to provide a stricter command structure that includes new policies designed to enhance discipline and improve the way rallies are conducted. The
                Proud Boys clearly spelled this out in private chat groups and meetings which they believed to be secure, yet at no point did any Proud Boy <i>ever</i> 
                claim (either on Telegram or during the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9HY3IVStIJc">Zoom meeting</a>) that the <b>MOSD</b> chapter had anything
                at all to do with some secret conspiracy to storm the Capitol on January 6th. Regardless, the prosecution repeatedly claimed (without any supporting evidence)
                that the <b>MOSD</b> chapter was established <i>specifically</i> for the express purpose of planning to storm the Capitol building on Jan 6.
                <br><br>

                which lasted over an hour and a half,

                statement uttered that even <i>remotely</i> hinted at the existence of some secret plan to storm the Capitol. Moreover, <b>Enrique Tarrio</b> 
                elaborated <i>at length</i> on the <i>actual</i>
                motivation that drove the creation of the <b>MOSD</b> chapter. It had
                nothing to do with any secret conspiracy and everything to do with <b>Tarrio's</b> frustrations over disciplinary problems with “rank-and-file” Proud Boys
                at national rallies. <b>Tarrio</b> was specifically frustrated over the major difficulty he experienced at previous rallies trying to maintain formation 
                while marching 
                large numbers of Proud Boys through the streets. <b>Tarrio</b> lamented that individual Proud Boys had the tendency to break formation during marches in order to
                run off and start unnecessary fights with nearby counter-protesters:

                Thus, the evidence clearly establishes that <b>Enrique Tarrio</b> established the <b>MOSD</b> chapter in order
                to improve discipline during rallies by establishing a stricter command structure and instituting new rallying
                policies like the <a href="https://youtu.be/9HY3IVStIJc?t=273">ban on intoxication</a> during marches and 
                <a href="https://youtu.be/9HY3IVStIJc?t=1019">splitting up
                into smaller ten-man squads</a> to make marches more manageable for leadership. 
                None of this is particularly compatible with the prosecution's claim that 
                the <b>MOSD</b> chapter was actually created for the express purpose
                of planning a secret <i><b>seditious conspiracy</b></i> to storm the US Capitol building on January 6th.
                <br><br>
                Finally, <b>Tarrio's</b> long-term vision for the new <b>MOSD</b> chapter was that eventually 
                it would enable leadership to control and direct <i>thousands</i> of Proud Boys in a public march while maintaining formation and

                In these Telegram posts, Proud Boy leaders <b>Jeremy Bertino</b> (Noble Beard The Immortal) and <b>Charles Donohoe</b> (YutYut Cowabunga)
                announce the new “<b>Ministry of Self Defense</b>” (<b>MOSD</b>) chapter in a private chat group for prospective <b>MOSD</b> members. 
                The purpose of the <b>MOSD</b> chapter
                was a hotly contested topic during the conspiracy trial. The prosecution argued that the <b>MOSD</b> chapter was specifically
                created for the express purpose of planning to storm the US Capitol building on January 6th. However, the evidence from 
                Telegram chats and the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9HY3IVStIJc"><b>MOSD Zoom meeting</b> on December 30th, 2020</a> 
                paint a completely different picture. This evidence clearly establishes
                that <b>Enrique Tarrio</b> established the <b>MOSD</b> chapter to <a href="#anc4">
                address disciplinary issues</a> that cropped up among the “rank-and-file” Proud Boys during the previous MAGA 
                rally in D.C. on December 12th, 2020. (See the <b>MOSD</b> Zoom call video or
                <a href="https://sigsegv1980.github.io/j6/ProudBoys-2020-12-30-MOSDZoomMeetingTranscript.pdf">transcript</a> 
                at timestamps <a href="https://youtu.be/9HY3IVStIJc?t=438"><b>7:18</b></a>,
                <a href="https://youtu.be/9HY3IVStIJc?t=2015"><b>33:35</b></a> and <a href="https://youtu.be/9HY3IVStIJc?t=2161"><b>36:01</b></a>)
                <br><br>
                The Telegram posts quoted in the left column further establish the actual purpose of the <b>MOSD</b> chapter as a 
                <b><i>“business only chapter for organizing and running security for national events”</i></b>. This description
                is consistent with <a href="#anc4">several other statements</a> made by Proud Boy leaders on Telegram and Zoom.
                <br><br>
                Additionally, the Telegram post from <b>Jeremy Bertino</b> quoted in the left column includes a link to the
                <a href="https://sigsegv1980.github.io/j6/ProudBoys-MOSDMemberApplicationForm.pdf"><b>MOSD Application Form</b></a>. 
                The form included various affirmations with corresponding check-boxes that applicants had to click in order to express
                agreement, such as <b><i>“I will always act in self defense and I will never initiate a confrontation”</i></b>. (This
                affirmation seems particularly counter-productive if your goal is to storm the US Capitol building, but it
                perfectly aligns with <b>Enrique Tarrio</b>'s <a href="#anc4">frustration over “rank-and-file” Proud Boys who break formation</a> 
                during marches and 
                <a href="https://youtu.be/9HY3IVStIJc?t=2161">run off without permission</a> to fight random counter-protesters.) The
                various affirmations included in the application form reflect the true purpose of the <b>MOSD</b> chapter as a
                more formal command structure with stricter rallying and disciplinary policies, like the ban on getting drunk
                during official Proud Boy events.
                <br><br>
                <a href="https://forms.gle/DofGT5YGSJbioo5Q7">

                </a>
                <br><br>
                Finally, the prosecution repeatedly brought up various statements from <b>MOSD</b> Proud Boys that emphasized the importance
                of <b>secrecy</b> and strict <b><i>operations security</i></b> (OPSEC), such as the <b>MOSD</b> policy forbidding the sharing
                of any screenshots of <b>MOSD</b>-related Telegram chat groups. (See <b>Charles Donohoe's</b> comments during the 12/30/2020
                <a href="https://youtu.be/9HY3IVStIJc?t=305"><b>MOSD Zoom call</b></a> at timestamp <b>5:05</b>.) The prosecution
                framed this as suspicious and incriminating behavior, implying the Proud Boys were concerned about secrecy and security 
                primarily because they
                were secretly making plans to storm the US Capitol building on January 6th. 
                <br><br>
                Yet throughout the <i>entire</i> <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9HY3IVStIJc"><b>MOSD Zoom meeting</b></a> on December 30th, 2020, 
                which lasted over an hour and a half (see the <a href="https://sigsegv1980.github.io/j6/ProudBoys-2020-12-30-MOSDZoomMeetingTranscript.pdf">full transcript</a>), 
                none of the <b>MOSD</b> Proud Boys uttered a <i>single</i>
                statement that even <i>remotely</i> hinted at the existence of some secret plan to storm the Capitol. Moreover, <b>Enrique Tarrio</b> 
                elaborated <i>at length</i> on the <i>actual</i>
                motivation that drove the creation of the <b>MOSD</b> chapter. It had
                nothing to do with any secret conspiracy and everything to do with <b>Tarrio's</b> 
                <a href="#anc4">frustrations over disciplinary problems</a> at national rallies
                (see timestamps <a href="https://youtu.be/9HY3IVStIJc?t=438"><b>7:18</b></a>,
                <a href="https://youtu.be/9HY3IVStIJc?t=2015"><b>33:35</b></a> and <a href="https://youtu.be/9HY3IVStIJc?t=2161"><b>36:01</b></a>). The reason for enforcing
                strict <b>OPSEC</b> practices was most likely to prevent sensitive information about
                Proud Boy activity from leaking out to the Proud Boys' political enemies, like the <i>“anti-fascist”</i> counter-protesters
                who had historically

                Additionally, the Proud Boys occassionally

                The Telegram posts quoted here in the left column constitute further evidence that the Proud Boys 
                feared similar stabbing incidents would occur at the (then upcoming) rally on January 6th, 2021. The topic of <b>stab proof protective gear</b> came up

                Clearly, the Proud Boys legitimately feared the possibility of getting stabbed once again in D.C. on January 6th. This strongly suggests that 
                in the weeks leading up to January 6th, the Proud Boys were operating under the assumption that January 6th would play out similarly to previous 
                MAGA rallies in D.C. (e.g. the <b>“Million MAGA March”</b> rallies on
                <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20201118012633/https://www.washingtonpost.com/dc-md-va/2020/11/14/million-maga-march-dc-protests/">November 14th</a> and

                both of which involved stabbing incidents), 
                and therefore the Proud Boys would have expected 
                their primary antagonist on Jan 6 to be <b>Antifa</b> (or other counter-protester groups). This expectation is also
                consistent with the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20171016061411/http://gothamist.com/2017/02/03/nyu_proud_boy_protest.php">history</a> of Proud Boy

                Indeed, the <b>US Capitol Police</b> released an intelligence briefing

                between the Proud Boys
                and <b>Antifa</b> on January 6th, just <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20201213043848/https://www.the-sun.com/news/1959359/million-maga-march-dc-trump-steal-election-stabbing/">
                like what happened during previous MAGA rallies</a>.
                Yet throughout the conspiracy trial,
                the prosecution repeatedly made the incredible claim that the Proud Boys were <i>not</i>, in fact, ever really interested in confronting <b>Antifa</b> on 
                January 6th, but rather 
                were primarily interested in attacking the D.C. police and storming the Capitol:

                        As laid bare by the defendants’ own words before and on January 6, the defendants’
                        preparation for conflict was not focused on Antifa — it was the preparation for conflict with law
                        enforcement and government officials who they had declared traitors.
                    </div>
                </div>
                To support this claim, the prosecution cited some instances on Telegram where the Proud Boys <a href="ProudBoys-IncriminatingChats.html#anc20">expressed negative sentiments 
                about the police</a>. Yet the large body of Telegram evidence wherein Proud Boy leaders discussed wearing

                prosecution's claim that the Proud Boys made preparations (like wearing body armor) specifically to attack the cops. The D.C. police generally do
                not use knives, <a href="https://sigsegv1980.github.io/j6/2020-07-05-USAvChristopherFellini.pdf#page=8">unlike <b>Antifa</b></a>, so the Proud Boys' keen interest in <b>stab proof vests</b> makes much less sense if the plan
                was to attack police and storm the Capitol building. In fact, on the morning of Jan 6 itself, 
                shortly before the Capitol riot began, the Proud Boys were 
                <a href="https://youtu.be/oSOsG5kN5wc?t=773">marching around the streets of D.C. while chanting <b>“Fuck Antifa!”</b></a> — a

                make it absolutely clear that the <b>MOSD</b> Proud Boys

                This Telegram post exemplifies the sort of discussion topics that went on in
                the <a href="https://sigsegv1980.github.io/j6/ProudBoys-MOSD-MAIN-FullChatMessages-2020-12-27_2021-1-1.pdf"><b>MOSD MAIN</b></a> 
                group chat during the week leading up to January 6th, 2021. Here, a Proud
                Boy using the Telegram handle <b>“Rotten”</b> is suggesting various techniques to improve
                the way the Proud Boys conduct rallies. He suggests things like splitting into smaller groups
                while using two-way radios and GPS tracking to coordinate. While <b>“Rotten”</b> was not
                one of the upper-tier <b>MOSD</b> leaders, his suggestions are perfectly consistent with

                Yet out of thousands of individual posts, there is nothing that even remotely suggests a secret
                plan to storm the US Capitol building. Moreover, none of the actual discussion topics in 
                <a href="https://sigsegv1980.github.io/j6/ProudBoys-MOSD-MAIN-FullChatMessages-2020-12-27_2021-1-1.pdf"><b>MOSD MAIN</b></a> make much sense 
                if we grant the prosecution's claim that the primary
                purpose of the <b>MOSD</b> chapter was to pre-plan the Jan 6 attack on the US Capitol building. For example, how 
                does <a href="https://youtu.be/9HY3IVStIJc?t=1019"><b>splitting into smaller groups</b></a> really help if the primary objective is 
                to incite hundreds of protesters to participate in a unified frontal assault on the US Capitol building? 
                <br><br>
                The actual discussion content and nature of the topics discussed in 
                <a href="https://sigsegv1980.github.io/j6/ProudBoys-MOSD-MAIN-FullChatMessages-2020-12-27_2021-1-1.pdf"><b>MOSD MAIN</b></a>
                throughout the week leading up to January 6th strongly suggests that the Proud Boys never had any plan 
                to storm the US Capitol building. Rather, both the <b>MOSD</b> leadership and the “rank and file” Proud Boys seemed to
                be operating under the assumption that the primary objective for the January 6 rally was to 
                <a href="https://sigsegv1980.github.io/j6/ProudBoys-MOSD-MAIN-FullChatMessages-2020-12-27_2021-1-1.pdf#page=194"><b>field test</b></a>
                the 
                new command structure and rallying policies established under the <b>MOSD</b> chapter. Essentially, <b>Enrique Tarrio</b> 
                wanted to use the January 6 rally as an opportunity to 
                <a href="https://youtu.be/9HY3IVStIJc?t=1051"><b>field test</b> strategies for coordinating multiple sub-groups of Proud Boys</a> in

                and “<a href="https://youtu.be/9HY3IVStIJc?t=1460"><b>stay as one fucking unit</b></a>”). Additionally, the stricter

                <i>NOT</i> (as the prosecution claimed) primarily made in anticipation of some secret plan to storm the Capitol and attack the police 
                (the cops generally don't stab people),

                In this Telegram post from <a href="https://sigsegv1980.github.io/j6/ProudBoys-MOSD-MAIN-FullChatMessages-2020-12-27_2021-1-1.pdf"><b>MOSD MAIN</b></a>,
                Proud Boy chairman <b>Enrique Tarrio</b> more or less spells out the agenda and objective for the (then upcoming) January 6th rally in Washington DC.
                He first establishes that the Proud Boys who attend the Jan 6 rally will be divided into two major groups. <b>Group 1</b> refers to the
                Proud Boys who are members of the newly established <b>“Ministry Of Self Defense”</b> (<b>MOSD</b>) chapter.
                <b>Group 2</b> refers to any other Proud Boys who are not members of <b>MOSD</b> but still wish to attend the Jan 6 rally in DC.
                <br><br>
                <b>Enrique Tarrio</b> explains that the <b>MOSD</b> Proud Boys (<b>Group 1</b>) will be <i><b>“running a training exercise”</b></i>
                throughout the day of January 6th. Clearly, <i>“running a training exercise”</i> is hardly equivalent to storming the
                Capitol. However, the prosecution would likely argue that <b>Tarrio</b> was intentionally obfuscating his true agenda
                for January 6th. But this is ultimately a circular argument, because the prosecution implicitly conceded that the
                Proud Boys who participated in these private, encrypted group chats on Telegram were expressing genuine beliefs whenever a Proud Boy said something
                that the prosecution considered incriminating.
                <br><br>
                Indeed, the body of Telegram evidence presented during the conspiracy trial
                consisted <i>entirely</i> of Telegram posts made in private, encrypted group chats that the Proud Boys believed to be secure (at least
                until January 4th, 2021, when <b>Enrique Tarrio</b> was 
                <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20220712213106/https://twitter.com/maustermuhle/status/1346521554855874565">arrested for an unrelated crime</a>). 
                Indeed, the Proud Boys regularly
                discussed <b><i>highly illegal</i></b> (but non-Capitol-storming-related) activities in these group chats, like
                participating in
                <a href="https://sigsegv1980.github.io/j6/ProudBoys-ExportedTelegramChatMOSDOp/messages.html#go_to_message489">violent street fights with <b>Antifa</b></a>
                or <a href="https://sigsegv1980.github.io/j6/ProudBoys-ExportedTelegramChatMOSDOp/messages.html#go_to_message533">illegally carrying a concealed knife</a>. 
                There is no evidence
                supporting the claim that any statements from the <b>MOSD</b> Telegram group chats were intentionally
                obfuscated or written in some kind of secret code language to conceal the true meaning. At best, the Proud Boys occasionally used the common
                Internet meme-phrase “<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20220720202033/https://www.reddit.com/r/legaladviceofftopic/comments/fzx93m/in_minecraft_meme/"><b><i>in minecraft</i></b></a>”
                as a humorously ironic <i>“wink-wink”</i> after bringing up certain illegal acts like
                getting into <a href="https://sigsegv1980.github.io/j6/ProudBoys-MOSD-Main-2020-12-27_2021-1-4.pdf#page=7">violent street battles with <b>Antifa</b></a>.
                <br><br>
                Furthermore, <b>Enrique Tarrio's</b> claim that the <b>MOSD</b> Proud Boys would be <b><i>“running a training exercise”</i></b> throughout
                the day of January 6th is <b><i>entirely consistent</i></b> with several other statements (from both Telegram and the private
                <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9HY3IVStIJc"><b>MOSD</b> Zoom meeting</a>) that also described the agenda for January 6th 
                as involving a <i><b>“test”</b></i> of some sort. For example, when elaborating on the organizational structure of the <b>MOSD</b> chapter,
                <b>Enrique Tarrio</b> said:

                        being in this group. Again the choice is yours. But we are going to be <b>using the 6th as a test</b>.

                When we synthesize <b>Enrique Tarrio's</b> description of the agenda for Jan 6 <i>“<a href="https://sigsegv1980.github.io/j6/ProudBoys-MOSD-MAIN-FullChatMessages-2020-12-27_2021-1-1.pdf#page=194"><b>as a test</b></a>”</i>
                involving <i>“<a href="https://sigsegv1980.github.io/j6/ProudBoys-MOSD-MAIN-FullChatMessages-2020-12-27_2021-1-1.pdf#page=118"><b>training exercises</b></a>”</i>
                with Tarrio's other statements about remaining 
                <i>“<a href="https://youtu.be/9HY3IVStIJc?t=1051"><b>as a nucleus</b></a>”</i> and 
                staying <i>“<a href="https://youtu.be/9HY3IVStIJc?t=1460"><b>as one fucking unit</b></a>”</i>, 
                Tarrio's <b>TRUE</b> plan for January 6th becomes pretty clear. It had nothing to do with
                some <b>seditious conspiracy</b> to storm the Capitol building. Rather, <b>Tarrio</b> essentially wanted to use the January 6 rally 
                to <b>field test</b> a march with the <b>MOSD</b> Proud Boys through the streets of DC. The objective was to 
                <a href="https://youtu.be/9HY3IVStIJc?t=1019">split the attending <b>MOSD</b> Proud Boys into smaller <b>ten-man squads</b></a> while maintaining a single overall marching 
                formation (“<a href="https://youtu.be/9HY3IVStIJc?t=1460"><b>stay as one fucking unit</b></a>” 
                and “<a href="https://youtu.be/9HY3IVStIJc?t=1051"><b>remain as a nucleus</b></a>”). The stricter <b>MOSD</b> command structure 
                and rallying policies (e.g. <a href="https://youtu.be/9HY3IVStIJc?t=273">forbidding intoxication</a>) were intended to help leadership 
                coordinate the ten-man squads while maintaining a single 
                formation like a well-disciplined and unified infantry. 
                <br><br>
                Finally, <b>Tarrio's</b> long-term vision for the new <b>MOSD</b> chapter was that eventually 
                it would enable leadership to control and direct <i>thousands</i> of Proud Boys in a public march while maintaining formation and 
                ensuring discipline among the “rank and file”:

                In this Telegram conversation, <b>MOSD</b> Proud Boy <b>Travis Vancouver PB</b> asks where the
                main events in Washington DC for the (then upcoming) January 6th rally will be located. In reality,
                many different organizations affiliated with the “<b>Stop The Steal</b>” movement had obtained
                <a href="https://sigsegv1980.github.io/j6/USCapitolPolicePermitsForEventsNearCapitol.pdf"><b>event permits</b></a>
                to hold rallies at various locations in DC, including Capitol Hill and Freedom Plaza. The locations
                and guest speakers at some of these events changed significantly after it was announced there would
                be a “main event” with 
                <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20210103160805/https://twitter.com/realDonaldTrump/status/1345753534168506370">
                President Trump giving a speech at the Ellipse</a>. The following

                contains an earlier version of the Jan 6 event program before President Trump's speech at the Ellipse was announced.
                Of course, most of the other events listed in this flyer were cancelled after hundreds of Trump supporters began storming the Capitol
                building in the early afternoon of January 6th.

                Apart from President Trump's speech, which was held at the Ellipse for security reasons, most of the official events scheduled 
                for the day of January 6th, 2021, were to be held near the US Capitol building. 
                For example, “<b>Latinos For Trump</b>” had an

                        Watching his video yesterday, well a highlight of it, he is claiming himself and other leaders made the decision to not go in

                        DC chapter has requested this and we were honoring this. I personally think showing up out

                        All right so with the
                        10 man squad, the reason we're picking 10 instead of others is you can count the 10 on your two hands,
                        so if you're that squad leader, you can't, you only count 9, you're fucked up.
                        Um, and... but even with the big nucleus — roll as a nucleus —
                        I suggest, Enrique, that we still put it into 10 man squad, that way we have full 100% accountability,
                        so nobody goes missing.

                        but you
                        either decide to be with us, or you decide to be with your chapter. And this, and there's no... there's

                        in DC. We were really disorganized and there was a lot of problems that kind of came from that disorganization.

                        thing of this is, you know, with a thousand Proud Boys in DC, you know, we were together sometimes,
                        we're all over the place sometimes, but there was no way to control, you know, um, there's no control
                        over that. So hopefully with this, with this new structure in place, what we'll be able to do is, it'll give us the
                        freedom and
                        flexibility to break off into modular elements where you can have smaller teams
                        that can maybe go two blocks over without everybody just following you know, you know, the guys
                        — and now you have 700 guys going, you know, two blocks over, just because they see the guy next to him moving.
                        You know, now
                        we'll have a little bit more
                        control where we can send elements in different directions and different places to do different things
                        and not necessarily in
                        an offensive manner, but just generally speaking, so we can have that that kind of
                        control.

                        something that we all need to talk about, but the escalation of force — obviously we're the ministry is
                        self-defense, so escalation of force isn't going to be to go out and attack. Um, it's going to be
                        more of like a bodyguard system. So obviously we'll be around
                        the marketing team, a.k.a. the dudes that get
                        all the press and stuff like that, and basically be a bodyguard service for the mission that they're trying
                        to accomplish. 
                        <br><br>
                        But that being said, there's also going to be smaller teams that go out and do things
                        like recon and quick reaction force in case somebody gets jammed up in a bind, and also to provide
                        information back to that main element. So as of now, I think we all agree on
                        this with the escalation of force — it's in strictly a defensive mode.
                        Um, unless the threat is so imminent that you believe that your life is in danger. What do you
                        think?

                        Yeah, um, to touch on that subject, staying together is probably like the most important thing. We had so 
                        many fucking people go off on their own. That's one of the — that's actually the biggest problem that we had. 
                        Uh, I spend — and this includes in most rallies, but it's more controllable when it's a smaller group — I spend 
                        most of my time in rallies fucking bringing people back. I'm just fucking corralling everybody, right?

                        Since this whole chapter is volunteer, I had a thought on how to keep order. I watched a lot of dumb shit 
                        go down in DC where Beard was trying to keep the peace and people were pretty much like “fuck him”. Acting

                        I know some of the guys are, they seem to
                        be a little upset but, what I’m hearing is,
                        uh, the Ministry is together – uh, maybe not
                        exactly as we initially planned, but I think
                        Rufio, Joe, and Zach are doing the best they
                        can with the cards that they were dealt. We
                        need to do the AAR and, uh, let the guys
                        speak, and uh they can talk about what
                        went well and what didn’t go well, and, uh,
                        we can make adjustments for the next time.
                        And then, make sure they understand, you
                        know, this was the first one. Uh, we had
                        quite a fucking hiccup thrown in, um, with
