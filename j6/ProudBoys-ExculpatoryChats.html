        <h2>Background</h2>
        <br>
        5 members of the <b>Proud Boys</b> were 
        <a href="https://sigsegv1980.github.io/j6/2022-06-06-USAvEthanNordeanAndJosephBiggsAndZacharyRehlAndEnriqueTarrioAndDominicPezzola-ThirdSupersedingIndictment.pdf">
        charged with <b>seditious conspiracy</b></a> for their role in the January 6, 2021 attack on the US Capitol building. 
        Prosecutors claimed that <b>Enrique Tarrio</b>, the leader and chairman of the Proud Boys at the time, conspired
        with <b>Ethan Nordean</b>, <b>Joseph Biggs</b>, <b>Zachary Rehl</b>, and <b>Dominic Pezzola</b>, to storm the
        US Capitol building for the purpose of overturning the 2020 election results, by riling up a large crowd of "normie"
        pro-Trump protesters and using them as a battering ram to breach police defensive lines and occupy the Capitol
        building. The defense acknowledged that some <b>Proud Boys</b> participated in the Capitol riot on January 6, but denied 
        that the defendants actually <i>planned</i> in advance of January 6 to storm the Capitol, claiming instead that the
        Capitol riot was a spontaneous event.
        <br><br>
        The evidence presented by the prosecution to support the <b>seditious conspiracy</b> charges included video footage from January 6, 
        but focused primarily around online activity (mostly Telegram and Parler posts) demonstrating that the Proud Boys made statements 
        that could be interpreted as incriminating evidence of planning in advance to storm the Capitol. The prosecution filed 
        <a href="https://sigsegv1980.github.io/j6/2022-06-06-USAvEthanNordeanAndJosephBiggsAndZacharyRehlAndEnriqueTarrioAndDominicPezzola-ThirdSupersedingIndictment.pdf">
        <b>an indictment</b></a>
        against the 5 Proud Boy conspirators that listed incriminating Telegram and Parler messages in support of the <b>seditious conspiracy</b>
        charges. All of the defendants, except <b>Dominic Pezzola</b>, were found guilty of <b>seditious conspiracy</b> and 
        <a href="https://sigsegv1980.github.io/j6/2023-09-15-USAvEnriqueTarrio-Judgment.pdf">sentenced to at least 15 years</a>
        in prison. I review all of the <a href="https://sigsegv1980.github.io/j6/ProudBoys-IncriminatingChats.html">
        <b>incriminating Telegram and Parler evidence</b></a> on a separate webpage.
        <br><br>
        I take the position that the <b>seditious conspiracy</b> charges were <b><i>largely baseless</i></b>, and <b>all 5 defendants should
        have been acquitted</b> of that charge due to reasonable doubt.  There is no doubt that some <b>Proud Boys</b> participated in the Capitol riot on 
        January 6 and even <i>enthusiastically</i> supported and praised the Jan 6 rioters. But the prosecution's evidence that the Proud Boys actually planned in 
        advance to storm the Capitol is <a href="https://sigsegv1980.github.io/j6/ProudBoys-IncriminatingChats.html">
        incredibly weak and unconvincing</a>. Additionally, there is a large body of <b>exculpatory evidence</b> 
        (evidence suggesting a <b>not guilty</b> verdict)
        found among the Telegram and Parler data in evidence. Here, I go over the most compelling examples of such <b>exculpatory evidence</b>.
        Most of the relevant evidence is available publicly. I have provided a convenient summary of the available sources of trial evidence, and 
        I encourage readers to examine the raw trial evidence and reach their own conclusions.

        <h2>Sources Of Evidence (so you can reach your own conclusion)</h2>
        <br>
        The trial evidence mostly centered around Telegram and Parler messages from the defendants, particularly the Telegram messages
        from private group chats affiliated with a chapter of the <b>Proud Boys</b> called <b><i>“The Ministry of Self Defense” (MOSD)</b></i>. As an organization,
        the <b>Proud Boys</b> (<a href="https://sigsegv1980.github.io/j6/ProudBoysConstitutionAndBylaws.pdf">Proud Boys International, L.L.C.</a>)
        were divided into several <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20201126161545/https://proudboysusa.com/chapters/">autonomous regional chapters</a>, 
        loosely governed by Chairman <b>Enrique Tarrio</b> and a council of “Elders”. In December of 2020,
        <b>Enrique Tarrio</b> created <b>“The Ministry of Self Defense”</b> as a new, <i>national-level</i> chapter 
        for organizing national events. The prosecution argued that <b>Tarrio</b> established the <b>MOSD</b> chapter specifically for the purpose
        of planning the January 6 insurrection. Therefore, the majority of the prosecution's
        evidence consisted of messages pulled from multiple private Telegram chat groups affiliated with the <b>MOSD</b> chapter of the Proud Boys.
        <br><br>
        Most of the relevant evidence is available publicly. Some of it can be found in
        the <b>Government Exhibits</b> filed electronically with <a href="https://pacer.uscourts.gov/"><b>PACER</b></a>, which I have organized into  
        separate PDF files for each Telegram group (linked below). The
        Telegram evidence from Government Exhibits usually consists of excerpts selected by the prosecution that omit most of the surrounding context.
        Fortunately, we also have a more complete record of some Telegram groups thanks to 
        <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20220827161137/https://t.me/helpstophate/5468"><b><i>leaked documents</i></b></a> (authenticated
        by the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20220708221152/https://www.seattletimes.com/seattle-news/times-watchdog/seattle-proud-boy-reveals-he-was-in-chapter-alleged-to-have-planned-jan-6-insurrection/">Seattle Times</a>) containing
        Telegram chat history recovered by the FBI using forensic software called <a href="https://cellebrite.com/en/home/"><b>Cellebrite</b></a>. Finally, 
        I have also personally recovered

        This webpage lists examples of <b>exculpatory evidence</b> (evidence suggesting a <b>not guilty</b> verdict) found within the collection
        of Telegram and Parler messages in evidence for the Proud Boys <b>seditious conspiracy</b> trial. 
        The analysis is organized in a 3 column layout. The <b>left-most</b> column shows the
        <b>date and time</b> associated with each relevant piece of evidence. The <b>middle column</b> quotes the Telegram/Parler evidence verbatim,
        and links to the source of the evidence.
        The <b>right column</b> analyzes the quoted Telegram/Parler evidence and explains why it is <b>exculpatory</b>.

                including <b>Joe Biggs</b>, <b>Ethan Nordean</b>, <b>Zach Rehl</b>, and <b>John Charles Stewart</b> (a.k.a. “<b>Johnny Blackbeard</b>”). 
                <br><br>
                Initially, <b>Enrique Tarrio</b> provided a rather terse mission statement for the <b>MOSD</b> chapter:
                <i>“<a href="https://sigsegv1980.github.io/j6/ProudBoys-SkullAndBonesChat-2020-9-29_2021-1-4.pdf#page=11"><b>to standardize event organizing</b></a>”</i>.
                Other <b>MOSD</b> Proud Boys ascribed similar purposes to the <b>MOSD</b> chapter, including
                <i>“<a href="https://sigsegv1980.github.io/j6/ProudBoys-MOSD-MAIN-FullChatMessages-2020-12-27_2021-1-1.pdf#page=279"><b>a structure to make events better</b></a>”</i>
                and 
                <i>“<a href="https://sigsegv1980.github.io/j6/ProudBoys-MOSDProspectsSmall.pdf"><b>a 
                professional business only chapter for organizing and running security for national events</b></a>”</i> (Govt Exhibit <b>513-1</b>).
                In contrast, during the conspiracy trial,
                the prosecution claimed that the <b>MOSD</b> chapter was created for the <i>specific</i> purpose of
                planning an attack on the US Capitol to be carried out on January 6th, 2021.
                <br><br>
                In the Telegram conversation quoted in the left column, <b>John Charles Stewart</b> (a.k.a. <b>Johnny Blackbeard</b>) 
                asks <b>Enrique Tarrio</b>
                if the <b>MOSD</b> Proud Boys will be traveling to Washington DC as a group on January 6, 2021. <b>Johnny Blackbeard</b> alludes to 
                something he expects to happen on 
                January 6 that he calls <b><i>“the after party”</i></b>. The prosecution
                would probably interpret <b><i>“the after party”</i></b> as a veiled allusion to a secret plan to storm the Capitol.
                <br><br>
                However, an <b><i>“after party”</i></b> generally describes a <b>night-time</b> event, and 
                the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20201212185503/https://www.nbcwashington.com/news/trump-supporters-protest-in-dc-crowds-gather-at-freedom-plaza/2475292/">

                informs us that <b><i>“the after party”</i></b> almost
                certainly alludes to the anticipated late-night street fights with local <b>anti-fascist counter-protesters</b>
                (herein referred to using the umbrella term <b>“Antifa”</b>). The Proud Boys had good reasons to expect
                violent conflict with <b>Antifa</b> on January 6, because this is exactly what happened during the two previous
                <b>“Million MAGA March”</b> rallies in DC on

                Shortly before January 6, both the

                released intelligence briefings that predicted there would be violent clashes between the Proud Boys and counter-protester groups in the 
                streets of DC on January 6th, just as there was during earlier MAGA rallies in DC in November and December of 2020.
                The <b>US Park Police</b> released a similar 
                <a href="https://sigsegv1980.github.io/j6/2020-12-28-UnitedStatesParkPoliceExecutiveBrief-6January2021-WMADemonstrationsActivity.pdf"><b>intelligence briefing</b></a> 
                predicting <b>street battles</b> between the <b>Proud Boys</b> and <b>Antifa</b> in Washington DC on January 6, 2021, warning that 
                <i>“we should expect an event similar to those that occurred on 14 November 2020
                and 12 December 2020 in Washington, DC”</i> and that <i>“we do anticipate street-level confrontation/violence 
                between [the Proud Boys and counter-protesters]”</i>.
                <br><br>
                An <a href="https://sigsegv1980.github.io/j6/USParkPoliceEventPreBrief-DCProtestsOn9December2020-MillionMAGAMarch-ProudBoysvAntifa.pdf">
                earlier intelligence briefing from the <b>US Park Police</b></a>
                explicitly identified <b>Antifa</b></a> as the <i>“main combatants with the Proud Boys”</i>
                during the MAGA rally in D.C. on November 14, 2020, and correctly predicted that 
                <i>violent street fighting</i> would break out during the December 12th rally, warning that the Proud Boys were likely to clash
                with a <i>“radical group ... made up of individuals who self-identify with the <b>Antifa</b> identity”</i>,
                and that <b><i>“it is almost a certainty that violent confrontations will occur between members of opposing groups”</i></b>.
                <br><br>
                This prognosis is almost certainly what the <b>Proud Boys</b> themselves
                also believed would happen on January 6, which is why <b>Johnny Blackbeard</b> used the phrase <b><i>“the after party”</i></b>
                to describe the anticipated late night street fighting with <b>Antifa</b> as a distinct event that would occur <i>after</i> the day time <i>“<b>protest portion</b>”</i>.

                clash violently with <b>Antifa</b> counter-protesters</a>
                in the streets. <b>Johnny Blackbeard</b>'s reference to an anticipated <b><i>“after party”</i></b> also highlights the fact that the <b>Proud Boys</b> were 
                focused primarily on
                <a href="https://sigsegv1980.github.io/j6/ProudBoys-ExportedTelegramChatMOSDOp/messages.html#go_to_message432">preparing for a rematch with <b>Antifa</b></a> 
                on January 6, rather than some secret plot to storm the Capitol. This is consistent with a
                <a href="https://sigsegv1980.github.io/j6/USParkPoliceEventPreBrief-DCProtestsOn9December2020-MillionMAGAMarch-ProudBoysvAntifa.pdf">
                <b>US Park Police</b> intelligence briefing</a> released
                prior to the December 12th MAGA rally in DC warning that <i><b>“each side has been preparing for this "rematch"”</b></i>.
                <br><br>
                Thus, the fact that <b>Johnny Blackbeard</b>'s conception of the upcoming Jan 6 rally entailed a <i>“<b>protest portion</b>”</i>
                followed by an <i>“<b>after party</b>”</i>, <i>strongly</i> suggests that at the time of these Telegram posts on December 20th, 2020,
                the <b>MOSD</b> Proud Boys had no knowledge whatsoever of any plan to storm the Capitol, and instead seemed to be operating under
                the assumption that the January 6 rally 
                would play out similarly to previous D.C. MAGA rallies.

                Of course, the prosecution maintained that <b>Enrique Tarrio</b> created the <b>“Ministry Of Self Defense”</b> (<b>MOSD</b>) chapter for the 
                specific purpose of planning the Jan 6 insurrection. 
                But <b>Enrique Tarrio's</b> response to <b>Johnny Blackbeard</b> (quoted in the left column) where he said
                <i>“<b>... let’s get this shit started so we can get a test run in</b>”</i> 
                is an important clue that helps us tease out the <i>ACTUAL</i> purpose of the <b>MOSD</b> chapter as well 
                as Enrique Tarrio's <b><i>TRUE</i></b> plans for January 6th. 
                <br><br>
                While the initial <i>“<a href="https://sigsegv1980.github.io/j6/ProudBoys-SkullAndBonesChat-2020-9-29_2021-1-4.pdf#page=11"><b>mission statement</b></a>”</i> 
                for the <b>MOSD</b> chapter was pretty bare-bones,  
                <b>Enrique Tarrio</b> did further elaborate on the purpose of the <b>MOSD</b> chapter. Tarrio explained that the <b>MOSD</b> 
                was established to prevent aggressive or insubordinate
                behavior from “rank-and-file” Proud Boys at national events, and to make it easier for the Proud Boy leadership to control and direct

                in detail the organizational
                structure and purpose of the newly established “<b>Ministry Of Self Defense</b>” (<b>MOSD</b>) chapter.
                Tarrio explained that  
                the <b>MOSD</b> chapter had a stricter command structure intended to ensure that individual Proud Boys do not break formation
                or behave insubordinately during official marches. The <b>MOSD</b> chapter also instituted new rallying policies 
                such as <a href="https://youtu.be/9HY3IVStIJc?t=1019">splitting up into smaller <b>10 man  
                squads</b></a>, <a href="https://youtu.be/9HY3IVStIJc?t=3668">forbidding official Proud Boy colors</a>,

                and acting <b><i>defensively</i></b> at all times (timestamps

                <br><br>
                These new policies were

                The new <b>MOSD</b> chapter was designed to address these disciplinary and organizational issues while also making it easier for
                leadership to control and direct large numbers of Proud Boys during 
                public marches. This had proven 
                <a href="https://youtu.be/9HY3IVStIJc?t=4858">very
                difficult to do at earlier rallies</a>, and the reason for splitting up into ten man squads was, as <b>MOSD</b> leader
                <b>Johnny Blackbeard</b> explained, because <i>“<a href="https://youtu.be/9HY3IVStIJc?t=4840"><b>it's easier to herd ten cats than a hundred</b></a>”</i>.
                <br><br>
                <b>Enrique Tarrio</b> also clearly explained the purpose of attending the January 6 rally in DC: he wanted
                to use the Jan 6 rally as an opportunity to <b><i>field test</i></b> the new <b>MOSD</b> command structure and rallying policies. For example, in the 
                <a href="https://sigsegv1980.github.io/j6/ProudBoys-MOSD-MAIN-FullChatMessages-2020-12-27_2021-1-1.pdf#page=194"><b>MOSD Main Telegram group chat</b></a>, Tarrio
                stated <b><i>“we are going to be using the 6th as a test”</i></b> and explained that the <b>MOSD</b> chapter would be
                running <i><b>“training exercises”</b></i> during <a href="https://sigsegv1980.github.io/j6/ProudBoys-MOSD-MAIN-FullChatMessages-2020-12-27_2021-1-1.pdf#page=118">
                <i>“the 5th at night and 6th throughout the day”</i></a>.
                This is consistent with <b>Tarrio's</b> comments
                during the <b>MOSD Zoom meeting</b> (timestamp <a href="https://youtu.be/9HY3IVStIJc?t=1051"><b>17:31</b></a>)
                elaborating on the new policy of splitting up into smaller 10-man squads and summarizing the actual
                plan for January 6th: <i>“<b>As of right now, the plans for the sixth is just to remain as a nucleus</b>”</i>. 
                Essentially, <b>Tarrio</b> wanted to use the Jan 6 rally as an opportunity to <b>test drive the new MOSD</b> chapter by trying to navigate the 
                streets of DC as a cohesive, disciplined, well-oiled infantry, subdivided into 10 man squads orbiting a single <i>“<b>nucleus</b>”</i>:

                Later on during the <b>MOSD</b> Zoom meeting, <b>Enrique Tarrio</b> further clarified what he meant by “<b><i>remain as a nucleus</i></b>”:

                        reiterate, like we need to do national events a lot better than what we've, we've been doing in the past.

                    </div>
                </div>
                When we synthesize <b>Enrique Tarrio's</b> statements about “<b><i>remaining as a nucleus</i></b>” and 
                staying <b><i>“as one fucking unit”</i></b> with his other statements describing the agenda for January 6th
                <i>“<a href="https://sigsegv1980.github.io/j6/ProudBoys-MOSD-MAIN-FullChatMessages-2020-12-27_2021-1-1.pdf#page=194"><b>as a test</b></a>”</i>
                involving <i>“<a href="https://sigsegv1980.github.io/j6/ProudBoys-MOSD-MAIN-FullChatMessages-2020-12-27_2021-1-1.pdf#page=118"><b>training exercises</b></a>”</i>,
                Tarrio's <i><b>TRUE</b></i>
                plans for January 6th become pretty clear. Again, <b>Tarrio</b> basically wanted to use the January 6 rally 
                to <b><i>field test</i></b> a march with the <b>MOSD</b> Proud Boys through the streets of DC. The objective was to
                divide the attending <b>MOSD</b> Proud Boys into ten-man squads while maintaining 
                a single overall marching formation (<b><i>“stay as one fucking unit”</i></b> and <b><i>“remain as a nucleus”</i></b>). The stricter
                <b>MOSD</b> command structure and rallying policies (e.g. <a href="https://youtu.be/9HY3IVStIJc?t=273">banning alcohol</a>) were intended to help leadership
                coordinate the ten-man squads while maintaining a single overall formation like a well-disciplined and unified infantry.
                <br><br>
                This is why when <b>Johnny Blackbeard</b> asked <b>Enrique Tarrio</b> if the Proud Boys would be attending the rally
                on January 6 <i>“as a group”</i>, <b>Tarrio</b> responded affirmatively, and then added <i>“So let’s get this shit started <b>so we 
                can get a test run in</b>”</i>. Again, the Telegram evidence demonstrates pretty conclusively that <b>Enrique Tarrio</b> viewed January 6 primarily 
                as an opportunity to 
                <a href="https://sigsegv1980.github.io/j6/ProudBoys-MOSD-MAIN-FullChatMessages-2020-12-27_2021-1-1.pdf#194"><b>field test</b></a> 
                the new <b>MOSD</b> command structure and rallying policies — to take the <b>MOSD</b> chapter for a spin in the streets of D.C. and
                find out if it works as anticipated. This is also consistent with <b>Charles Donohoe</b>'s
                description of the plan for January 6th as 
                <i>“<a href="https://sigsegv1980.github.io/j6/ProudBoys-ExportedTelegramChatMOSDOp/messages.html#go_to_message441"><b>a simple and quick mission</b></a>”</i>.
                Furthermore, it's consistent with a Telegram voice message from the morning of January 6th itself, where <b>MOSD</b>
                leader <b>Ethan Nordean</b> can be heard <a href="https://sigsegv1980.github.io/j6/ProudBoys-NewMOSD-2021-1-4_2021-1-13.pdf#page=25">giving orders to a group of Proud Boys</a>,
                saying <i>“Right side, right side slow down, left side speed up, right side slow down”</i> as they marched through
                the streets of DC.
                <br><br>
                Indeed, the <b>MOSD</b> chapter was not tied exclusively to the Jan 6 rally. It was intended to be deployed at all future
                rallies in Washington DC for <i>years</i> to come. <b>Tarrio</b>'s long-term vision for the new <b>MOSD</b> chapter was that eventually
                it would enable Proud Boy leadership to control and direct <i>one thousand or more</i> Proud Boys in a public march while maintaining formation
                and ensuring discipline among the “rank and file”.

                Of course, none of this has <i>anything</i> to do with a secret <i><b>seditious conspiracy</b></i> 
                to attack the Capitol. Throughout the entire hour and thirty-eight minute 
                <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9HY3IVStIJc"><b>MOSD Zoom conference</b></a>,
                wherein high-ranking <b>MOSD</b> leaders discuss plans for the new chapter in detail, there is not a <i>single</i>
                mention of anything remotely resembling a plan or conspiracy to storm the Capitol building. Furthermore,
                the prosecution's claim that the <b>MOSD</b> chapter was created specifically to plan
                an insurrection is refuted by the large body of Telegram evidence where the purpose of the <b>MOSD</b> chapter and
                the agenda for January 6th are <i>clearly</i> explained. The <b>MOSD</b> had absolutely <i>nothing</i> to do with some secret 
                conspiracy to storm the Capitol.
                <br><br>
                Finally, <b>Enrique Tarrio</b>
                had long-term plans and ambitions for the “<b>Ministry Of Self Defense</b>” chapter that went well
                beyond January 6th. He clearly exhibited a keen interest in slowly 
                and painstakingly growing the <b>MOSD</b>
                chapter over time until it eventually becomes a well-disciplined infantry with <i>one thousand or more</i> members. 
                This sort of sober, long-term planning
                and rational goal setting really doesn't leave much room for anything so acutely life-changing or disruptive as 
                a secret plan to storm the US Capitol building on January 6th. It is very likely that no such secret plan ever actually existed.

                The fact that many high-ranking <b>MOSD</b> leaders seemed to genuinely fear getting stabbed on January 6th 
                strongly suggests they assumed further violent conflict with <b>Antifa</b> on January 6th was highly probable. 
                If the Proud
                Boys were operating under the assumption that January 6th would play out similarly to previous MAGA rallies in D.C. (e.g. 
                the <b>“Million MAGA March”</b> rallies on 
                <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20201118012633/https://www.washingtonpost.com/dc-md-va/2020/11/14/million-maga-march-dc-protests/">November 14th</a> 
                and <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20201213045338/https://www.nbcwashington.com/news/local/trump-supporters-maga-rally-protest-dc-saturday/2506267/">December 12th
                of 2020</a>), then of course the Proud Boys would have expected their primary antagonist on Jan 6 to be <b>Antifa</b> (or other counter-protester groups). 
                Yet the prosecution repeatedly
                argued that the Proud Boys were <i>not</i>, in fact, worried about confronting <b>Antifa</b> on January 6th, but rather
                were primarily focused on attacking the D.C. police and storming the Capitol:

                    <a href="https://sigsegv1980.github.io/j6/2023-08-17-USAvEthanNordeanAndJosephBiggsAndZacharyRehlAndEnriqueTarrioAndDominicPezzola-GovernmentSentencingMemorandum.pdf">Sentencing memorandum reads</a>:
                    <div class="inner-blurb">
                        As laid bare by the defendants’ own words before and on January 6, the defendants’
                        preparation for conflict was not focused on Antifa — it was the preparation for conflict with law
                        enforcement and government officials who they had declared traitors.
                    </div>
                </div>
                To say that any of the <b>MOSD</b> Proud Boys were <i>“not focused on Antifa”</i> is a <b>brazen</b> lie that contradicts the
                vast amount of Telegram evidence wherein the Proud Boys discussed <a href="https://sigsegv1980.github.io/j6/ProudBoys-MOSD-MAIN-FullChatMessages-2020-12-27_2021-1-1.pdf#page=109">

                as well as <a href="https://sigsegv1980.github.io/j6/ProudBoys-ExportedTelegramChatMOSDOp/messages.html#go_to_message386">disguises to blend in with <b>Antifa</b></a>
                on January 6th. And on the morning of Jan 6 itself, shortly before the Capitol riot began, the Proud Boys 
                <a href="https://youtu.be/oSOsG5kN5wc?t=773">were marching around
                the streets of D.C. while chanting <b><i>“Fuck Antifa!”</i></b></a> — a 
                <a href="https://x.com/BGOnTheScene/status/1346645650147049476">popular Proud Boy chant</a> heard at 
                <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20201119003724/https://video.parler.com/Vw/KV/VwKViYWJTxob_small.mp4">many rallies</a>.
                The prosecution ignored <i>all of that</i>, and instead called attention to a few instances where
                a Proud Boy expressed anti-police sentiment, such as the January 5th Telegram post from <b>Aaron Wolkind</b> saying that 
                <a href="https://sigsegv1980.github.io/j6/ProudBoys-IncriminatingChats.html#anc33"><i>“cops are the primary threat”</i></a>. 
                But this single post from <b>Aaron Wolkind</b> — intended to address very 
                <a href="https://sigsegv1980.github.io/j6/ProudBoys-IncriminatingChats.html#anc33">specific circumstances</a> — is far outweighed
                by other Telegram evidence, including
                <a href="https://sigsegv1980.github.io/j6/ProudBoys-ExportedTelegramChatMOSDOp/messages.html"><i>entire conversations</i></a>, 
                spread across multiple days, where various <b>MOSD</b> Proud Boys (including upper-tier leaders like 
                <a href="https://sigsegv1980.github.io/j6/ProudBoys-ExportedTelegramChatMOSDOp/messages.html#go_to_message163"><b>Joe Biggs</b></a>
                and <a href="https://sigsegv1980.github.io/j6/ProudBoys-ExportedTelegramChatMOSDOp/messages.html#go_to_message432"><b>Enrique Tarrio</b></a>) 
                make it <i>absolutely clear</i> that <b>Antifa</b> is the primary topic of conversation and source of concern
                driving preparations for the January 6th rally.
                <br><br>
                In particular, the prosecution failed to account for the
                fact that the Proud Boys repeatedly discussed <b><i>stab proof</i></b> body armor on Telegram in preparation for the Jan 6 rally. 
                The D.C. police do not regularly use knives and generally don't stab people, so all those discussions about relatively expensive <b>stab-proof body armor</b>
                make little sense if the Proud Boys were primarily interested in attacking the cops. But <b>Antifa</b>
                <a href="https://sigsegv1980.github.io/j6/2020-07-05-USAvChristopherFellini.pdf#page=8">does occasionally use knives</a>,
                and multiple Proud Boys were 
                <a href="https://mpdc.dc.gov/release/arrest-made-assault-dangerous-weapon-knife-offense-500-block-11th-street-northwest">stabbed during an altercation with a counter-protester</a>
                (whom <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20210110204254/https://rumble.com/vcbz9d-rebel-talk-episode-2.html">Proud Boy leadership believed was affiliated</a> with 
                <b>Antifa</b>)
                during the previous D.C. rally in December of 2020. 
                Furthermore, Telegram posts from

                point out that the Proud Boys would need to hide their beards in order to successfully conceal their presence from

                This makes it definitively clear that the Proud Boys' preparations in advance of January 6th — including the use of protective equipment
                and <a href="https://sigsegv1980.github.io/j6/ProudBoys-ExportedTelegramChatMOSDOp/messages.html#go_to_message386">donning <b>Antifa</b>-style “black bloc” disguises</a> 
                — were primarily made <i>specifically</i> in anticipation of violent conflict with <b>Antifa</b> 
                <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yOeMrBGS1n8">after dark</a>, and had
                nothing to do with attacking cops or storming Capitols.
                <br><br>
                Of course, while the Proud Boys were primarily concerned with <b>Antifa</b> on January 6th, they were 
                also certainly quite <i>wary</i> of the D.C. police as well. Some Proud Boy leaders grew 
                <a href="https://apnews.com/article/biden-politics-proud-boys-donald-trump-washington-b6f19086dd983c9a653ab83043c5523f">particularly distrustful</a> of the cops in D.C.</a>
                after the <b>US Park Police</b> (who were 
                <a href="https://sigsegv1980.github.io/j6/USParkPoliceEventPreBrief-DCProtestsOn9December2020-MillionMAGAMarch-ProudBoysvAntifa.pdf">tasked with keeping

                obstructed the Proud Boys
                during the December 12th rally</a> in order to prevent street fighting with counter-protesters.
                Nonetheless, the Telegram evidence (especially the <a href="https://sigsegv1980.github.io/j6/ProudBoys-ExportedTelegramChatMOSDOp/messages.html">
                conversations in <b>MOSD Ops</b></a>) 
                makes it <i>abundantly</i> clear that the Proud Boys
                viewed <b>Antifa</b> (<i>not</i> the police) as their primary antagonist on January 6th, and
                <a href="https://sigsegv1980.github.io/j6/ProudBoys-ExportedTelegramChatMOSDOp/messages.html#go_to_message386">prepared accordingly</a>.
                <br><br>
                Finally, it should be noted that the Proud Boys' expectation of <b>Antifa</b>-related violence was shared by
                Federal law enforcement and intelligence agencies. Indeed, a

                <b>DHS/FBI intelligence briefing</b></a> released two days before Jan 6 warned that <i>“<b>anarchist violent extremists</b>
                likely will continue to pose a threat of
                violence — much of which will be non-lethal — against law enforcement, individuals, and
                institutions they view as symbols of authority, capitalism, and perceived oppression,
                particularly those believed to be racist or fascist.”</i> Furthermore, a

                intelligence brief released by the <b>US Capitol Police</b></a>,
                all predicted that there would be violent clashes between the Proud Boys and counter-protester groups in the streets of Washington D.C. on January 6th,
                just as there was during the previous two D.C. MAGA rallies in 
                <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20201118012633/https://www.washingtonpost.com/dc-md-va/2020/11/14/million-maga-march-dc-protests/">November</a>

                Thus, the Proud Boys' expectation of violent conflict with
                <b>Antifa</b> on Jan 6  
                was in fact shared by the 
                <b>Department of Homeland Security</b>, the <b>FBI</b>, the <b>Secret Service</b>, the <b>US Capitol Police</b>, <i>and</i> the <b>US Park Police</b>, due to the 
                violence observed during clashes with counter-protesters
                at earlier MAGA rallies throughout 2020. (The umbrella term <b>“Antifa”</b> overlaps with the <b>DHS/FBI</b> concept of

                In this Telegram post, Proud Boy Chairman <b>Enrique Tarrio</b> explains the purpose of the newly established
                <b>Ministry of Self Defense</b> (<b>MOSD</b>) chapter of the Proud Boys. The purpose of the <b>MOSD</b> was a hotly
                contested topic throughout the conspiracy trial. The prosecution claimed that <b>Enrique Tarrio</b> created the
                <b>MOSD</b> chapter for the <i>specific</i> purpose of planning to storm the Capitol on January 6th. However,
                the actual Telegram and video evidence tells a completely different story. In the Telegram post quoted on the left, <b>Enrique Tarrio</b> announced
                the newly established <b>MOSD</b> chapter in a private Telegram chat group for Proud Boy “elders”. Tarrio explained that
                the purpose of the <b>MOSD</b> was to <i>“discourage and remove new fags and aggressive members
                from attending national events”</i>. (The phrase <i>“new fags”</i> is not a slur, but rather a term carried over from
                4chan jargon meaning an inexperienced individual who is new to the sub-culture.) <b>Tarrio</b> justified the creation of the <b>MOSD</b> chapter 
                as the <i>“best compromise we can come up with to hold unruly members accountable at [national] events”.</i>
                <br><br>
                <b>Tarrio's</b> claim is consistent with other instances when Proud Boy leaders
                explained the purpose of the <b>MOSD</b> chapter, such as <b>Charles Donohoe</b>'s
                comments

                spelling out a concise <i>“mission statement”</i> for

                The new <b>MOSD</b> chapter instituted stricter rules and rallying policies intended to improve discipline and

                <a href="#anc2">above analysis of
                the <b>MOSD</b> chapter</a>.) These new policies included
                stricter OPSEC protocols and a ban on getting drunk during rallies:

                Thus, multiple high-ranking Proud Boy leaders <i>clearly</i> spelled out — on multiple occasions — the exact purpose of the <b>MOSD</b> chapter: 
                to provide a stricter command structure that includes new policies designed to enhance discipline and improve the way rallies are conducted. The
                Proud Boys clearly spelled this out in private chat groups and meetings which they believed to be secure, yet at no point did any Proud Boy <i>ever</i> 
                claim (either on Telegram or during the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9HY3IVStIJc">Zoom meeting</a>) that the <b>MOSD</b> chapter had anything
                at all to do with some secret conspiracy to storm the Capitol on January 6th. Regardless, the prosecution repeatedly claimed (without any supporting evidence)
                that the <b>MOSD</b> chapter was established <i>specifically</i> for the express purpose of planning to storm the Capitol building on Jan 6.
                <br><br>
                And yet throughout the <i>entire</i> <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9HY3IVStIJc"><b>MOSD Zoom meeting</b></a> on December 30th, 2020, 
                which lasted over an hour and a half, 
                there was not a <i>single</i>
                statement uttered that even <i>remotely</i> hinted at the existence of some secret plan to storm the Capitol. Moreover, <b>Enrique Tarrio</b> 
                elaborated <i>at length</i> on the <i>actual</i>
                motivation that drove the creation of the <b>MOSD</b> chapter. It had
                nothing to do with any secret conspiracy and everything to do with <b>Tarrio's</b> frustrations over disciplinary problems with “rank-and-file” Proud Boys
                at national rallies. <b>Tarrio</b> was specifically frustrated over the major difficulty he experienced at previous rallies trying to maintain formation 
                while marching 
                large numbers of Proud Boys through the streets. <b>Tarrio</b> lamented that individual Proud Boys had the tendency to break formation during marches in order to
                run off and start unnecessary fights with nearby counter-protesters:

                Thus, the evidence <i>clearly</i> establishes that <b>Enrique Tarrio</b> established the <b>MOSD</b> chapter in order
                to improve discipline during rallies by establishing a stricter command structure and instituting new rallying
                policies like the <a href="https://youtu.be/9HY3IVStIJc?t=273">ban on intoxication</a> during marches and 
                <a href="https://youtu.be/9HY3IVStIJc?t=1019">splitting up
                into smaller ten-man squads</a> to make marches more manageable for leadership. 
                None of this is particularly compatible with the prosecution's claim that 
                the <b>MOSD</b> chapter was actually created for the express purpose
                of planning a secret <i><b>seditious conspiracy</b></i> to storm the US Capitol building on January 6th.
                <br><br>
                Finally, <b>Tarrio's</b> long-term vision for the new <b>MOSD</b> chapter was that eventually 
                it would enable leadership to control and direct <i>thousands</i> of Proud Boys in a public march while maintaining formation and

                In these Telegram posts, Proud Boy leaders <b>Jeremy Bertino</b> (Noble Beard The Immortal) and <b>Charles Donohoe</b> (YutYut Cowabunga)
                announce the new “<b>Ministry of Self Defense</b>” (<b>MOSD</b>) chapter in a private chat group for prospective <b>MOSD</b> members. 
                The purpose of the <b>MOSD</b> chapter
                was a hotly contested topic during the conspiracy trial. The prosecution argued that the <b>MOSD</b> chapter was specifically
                created for the express purpose of planning to storm the US Capitol building on January 6th. However, the evidence from 
                Telegram chats and the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9HY3IVStIJc"><b>MOSD Zoom meeting</b> on December 30th, 2020</a> 
                paint a completely different picture. This evidence clearly establishes
                that <b>Enrique Tarrio</b> established the <b>MOSD</b> chapter to <a href="#anc4">
                address disciplinary issues</a> that cropped up among the “rank-and-file” Proud Boys during the previous MAGA 
                rally in D.C. on December 12th, 2020. (See the <b>MOSD</b> Zoom call video or
                <a href="https://sigsegv1980.github.io/j6/ProudBoys-2020-12-30-MOSDZoomMeetingTranscript.pdf">transcript</a> 
                at timestamps <a href="https://youtu.be/9HY3IVStIJc?t=438"><b>7:18</b></a>,
                <a href="https://youtu.be/9HY3IVStIJc?t=2015"><b>33:35</b></a> and <a href="https://youtu.be/9HY3IVStIJc?t=2161"><b>36:01</b></a>)
                <br><br>
                The Telegram posts quoted in the left column further establish the actual purpose of the <b>MOSD</b> chapter as a 
                <b><i>“business only chapter for organizing and running security for national events”</i></b>. This description
                is consistent with <a href="#anc4">several other statements</a> made by Proud Boy leaders on Telegram and Zoom.
                <br><br>
                Additionally, the Telegram post from <b>Jeremy Bertino</b> quoted in the left column includes a link to the
                <a href="https://sigsegv1980.github.io/j6/ProudBoys-MOSDMemberApplicationForm.pdf"><b>MOSD Application Form</b></a>. 
                The form included various affirmations with corresponding check-boxes that applicants had to click in order to express
                agreement, such as <b><i>“I will always act in self defense and I will never initiate a confrontation”</i></b>. (This
                affirmation seems particularly counter-productive if your goal is to storm the US Capitol building, but it
                perfectly aligns with <b>Enrique Tarrio</b>'s <a href="#anc4">frustration over “rank-and-file” Proud Boys who break formation</a> 
                during marches and 
                <a href="https://youtu.be/9HY3IVStIJc?t=2161">run off without permission</a> to fight random counter-protesters.) The
                various affirmations included in the application form reflect the true purpose of the <b>MOSD</b> chapter as a
                more formal command structure with stricter rallying and disciplinary policies, like the ban on getting drunk
                during official Proud Boy events.

                </a>
                <br><br>
                Finally, the prosecution repeatedly brought up various statements from <b>MOSD</b> Proud Boys that emphasized the importance
                of <b>secrecy</b> and strict <b><i>operations security</i></b> (<b>OPSEC</b>), such as the <b>MOSD</b> policy forbidding the sharing
                of any screenshots of <b>MOSD</b>-related Telegram chat groups. (See <b>Charles Donohoe's</b> comments during the 12/30/2020
                <a href="https://youtu.be/9HY3IVStIJc?t=305"><b>MOSD Zoom call</b></a> at timestamp <b>5:05</b>.) The prosecution
                framed this as suspicious and incriminating behavior, implying the Proud Boys were concerned about secrecy and security 
                primarily because they
                were secretly making plans to storm the US Capitol building on January 6th. 
                <br><br>
                Yet throughout the <i>entire</i> <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9HY3IVStIJc"><b>MOSD Zoom meeting</b></a> on December 30th, 2020, 
                which lasted over an hour and a half (see the <a href="https://sigsegv1980.github.io/j6/ProudBoys-2020-12-30-MOSDZoomMeetingTranscript.pdf">full transcript</a>), 
                none of the <b>MOSD</b> Proud Boys uttered a <i>single</i>
                statement that even <i>remotely</i> hinted at the existence of some secret plan to storm the Capitol. Moreover, the reason for enforcing
                strict <b>OPSEC</b> practices was most likely to prevent sensitive information about
                Proud Boy activity from leaking out to the Proud Boys' political enemies, like the <i>“anti-fascist”</i> counter-protesters
                who had historically
                <a href="https://sigsegv1980.github.io/j6/USParkPoliceEventPreBrief-DCProtestsOn9December2020-MillionMAGAMarch-ProudBoysvAntifa.pdf">
                showed up at rallies attended by the Proud Boys</a> and often monitored Proud Boy activity online.
                Additionally, the Proud Boys occassionally 
                discussed on Telegram certain highly <b><i>illegal</i></b> (but non-Capitol-storming-related) activities, such as
                <a href="https://sigsegv1980.github.io/j6/ProudBoys-ExportedTelegramChatMOSDOp/messages.html#go_to_message489">violent street fighting with counter-protesters</a> or

                to Washington DC. The Proud Boys also clearly and unambiguously announced on Telegram <a href="https://sigsegv1980.github.io/j6/ProudBoys-BootsOnTheGroundChat.pdf#page=10">
                that they were currently storming the Capitol</a> <i>after</i> the riot began in the 
                early afternoon of January 6th, so clearly they felt comfortable admitting to illegal activities on Telegram,
                at least until after January 6th when they had reason to believe their 
                <a href="https://sigsegv1980.github.io/j6/ProudBoys-NewMOSD-2021-1-4_2021-1-13.pdf#page=35">group chats were compromised</a> by law enforcement
                (Govt Exhibit <b>509-41</b>).
                Yet there is no Telegram evidence from <i>before</i> January 6 that clearly supports the existence of a plan or conspiracy to 
                storm the Capitol.

                The Telegram posts quoted here in the left column constitute further evidence that the Proud Boys 
                feared similar stabbing incidents would occur at the (then upcoming) rally on January 6th, 2021. The topic of <b>stab proof protective gear</b> came up 
                <a href="https://sigsegv1980.github.io/j6/ProudBoys-MOSD-MAIN-FullChatMessages-2020-12-27_2021-1-1.pdf#page=74">over and over throughout

                especially in 
                <a href="https://sigsegv1980.github.io/j6/ProudBoys-MOSD-MAIN-FullChatMessages-2020-12-27_2021-1-1.pdf"><b>MOSD MAIN</b></a>, 
                where significant portions of entire conversations center around <b>stab proof body armor</b>.
                <br><br>
                Clearly, the Proud Boys legitimately feared the possibility of getting stabbed once again in D.C. on January 6th. This strongly suggests that 
                in the weeks leading up to January 6th, the Proud Boys were operating under the assumption that January 6th would play out similarly to previous 
                MAGA rallies in D.C. (e.g. the <b>“Million MAGA March”</b> rallies on
                <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20201118012633/https://www.washingtonpost.com/dc-md-va/2020/11/14/million-maga-march-dc-protests/">November 14th</a> and 
                <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20201213045338/https://www.nbcwashington.com/news/local/trump-supporters-maga-rally-protest-dc-saturday/2506267/">December 12th of 2020</a>,
                both of which involved stabbing incidents), 
                and therefore the Proud Boys would have expected 
                their primary antagonist on Jan 6 to be <b>Antifa</b> (or other counter-protester groups). This expectation is also
                consistent with the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20171016061411/http://gothamist.com/2017/02/03/nyu_proud_boy_protest.php">history</a> of Proud Boy 
                <a href="https://archive.ph/POo6I">events/rallies</a>,

                counter-protester groups</a>
                (including local <i>anti-fascist</i> or anarchist groups) looking to 
                <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170828063717/https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/morning-mix/wp/2017/08/28/black-clad-antifa-attack-right-wing-demonstrators-in-berkeley/">
                disrupt or attack</a> pro-Trump demonstrations.
                Indeed, the <b>US Capitol Police</b> released an intelligence briefing 
                <a href="https://sigsegv1980.github.io/j6/SpecialEventAssessmentBulletin-PredictionOfJan6ProtestEvents.pdf#page=3">predicting violent conflict</a> 
                between the Proud Boys
                and <b>Antifa</b> on January 6th, just <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20201213043848/https://www.the-sun.com/news/1959359/million-maga-march-dc-trump-steal-election-stabbing/">
                like what happened during previous MAGA rallies</a>.
                Yet throughout the conspiracy trial,
                the prosecution repeatedly made the incredible claim that the Proud Boys were <i>not</i>, in fact, ever really interested in confronting <b>Antifa</b> on 
                January 6th, but rather 
                were primarily interested in attacking the D.C. police and storming the Capitol:

                    <div class="inner-blurb">
                        As laid bare by the defendants’ own words before and on January 6, the defendants’
                        preparation for conflict was not focused on Antifa — it was the preparation for conflict with law
                        enforcement and government officials who they had declared traitors.
                    </div>
                </div>
                To support this claim, the prosecution cited some instances on Telegram where the Proud Boys <a href="ProudBoys-IncriminatingChats.html#anc20">expressed negative sentiments 
                about the police</a>. Yet the large body of Telegram evidence wherein Proud Boy leaders discussed wearing

                prosecution's claim that the Proud Boys made preparations (like wearing body armor) specifically to attack the cops. The D.C. police generally do
                not use knives, <a href="https://sigsegv1980.github.io/j6/2020-07-05-USAvChristopherFellini.pdf#page=8">unlike <b>Antifa</b></a>, so the Proud Boys' keen interest in <b>stab proof vests</b> makes much less sense if the plan
                was to attack police and storm the Capitol building. In fact, on the morning of Jan 6 itself, 
                shortly before the Capitol riot began, the Proud Boys were 
                <a href="https://youtu.be/oSOsG5kN5wc?t=773">marching around the streets of D.C. while chanting <b>“Fuck Antifa!”</b></a> — a

                make it absolutely clear that the <b>MOSD</b> Proud Boys

                anticipated violent conflict with <b>Antifa</b> in D.C. on January 6th. Therefore, the Proud Boys' preparations involving

                <i>strongly</i> suggests the Proud Boys
                were <i>NOT</i> primarily preparing for a conflict with the cops (the cops don't generally carry knives or try to stab people),
                but rather had a conflict with <b>Antifa</b> in mind.

                protective gear and brought riot weapons to D.C. on January 6th because they expected violent

                violent
                conflict between the Proud Boys and Antifa</a> would occur at a previous MAGA rally in DC.
                The Proud Boys therefore had every reason to expect more violent conflict with <b>Antifa</b> on January 6th, 
                and most of the Proud Boys' preparations for the rally were made with such a conflict in mind.
                <br><br>
                The Telegram evidence quoted in the left column is a particularly effective exculpatory example demonstrating that when the
                Proud Boys discussed preparations for the (then upcoming) Jan 6 rally, they <i>very obviously</i> had <a href="https://youtu.be/yOeMrBGS1n8?t=139">street fighting
                with <b>Antifa</b></a> in mind. In the quoted Telegram post to the left, a <b>MOSD</b> Proud Boy using the handle “<b>Rotten</b>” 
                was talking about various types of protective body armor he planned to wear on January 6th, when he said 
                <i>“Knowing that <b>they try to stab you</b> under your vest means thinking outside the box”</i>. When we read
                the phrase <i><b>“they try to stab you”</b></i>, the 
                <a href="https://sigsegv1980.github.io/j6/ProudBoys-MOSD-MAIN-FullChatMessages-2020-12-27_2021-1-1.pdf#page=75">overall context of the unfolding discussions</a>
                throughout the group chat 
                (plus the fact that cops generally don't <i><b>“try to stab you”</b></i>) makes it indisputably clear that the
                pronoun <i><b>“they”</b></i> refers to <b>Antifa</b>.

                Yet out of thousands of individual posts, there is nothing that even remotely suggests a secret
                plan to storm the US Capitol building. Moreover, none of the actual discussion topics in 
                <a href="https://sigsegv1980.github.io/j6/ProudBoys-MOSD-MAIN-FullChatMessages-2020-12-27_2021-1-1.pdf"><b>MOSD MAIN</b></a> make much sense 
                if we grant the prosecution's claim that the primary
                purpose of the <b>MOSD</b> chapter was to pre-plan the Jan 6 attack on the US Capitol building. For example, how 
                does <a href="https://youtu.be/9HY3IVStIJc?t=1019"><b>splitting into smaller groups</b></a> really help if the primary objective is

                throughout the week leading up to January 6th strongly suggests that the Proud Boys never had any plan 
                to storm the US Capitol building. Rather, both the <b>MOSD</b> leadership and the “rank and file” Proud Boys seemed to
                be operating under the assumption that the primary objective for the January 6 rally was to 
                <a href="https://sigsegv1980.github.io/j6/ProudBoys-MOSD-MAIN-FullChatMessages-2020-12-27_2021-1-1.pdf#page=194"><b>field test</b></a>
                the 
                new command structure and rallying policies established under the <b>MOSD</b> chapter. Essentially, <b>Enrique Tarrio</b> 
                wanted to use the January 6 rally as an opportunity to 
                <a href="https://youtu.be/9HY3IVStIJc?t=1051"><b>field test</b> strategies for coordinating multiple sub-groups of Proud Boys</a> in

                        The DC trip will consist of two groups. None of which can be in colors.<br><br>
                        1. The first group of guys have been invited to a special chapter within the organization. If you haven't been invited...please be patient. 
                        We are growing the group slowly.<br><br>
                        2. The second group consists of PBs that are just attending the event. You can coordinate with other PBs and do whatever you guys want.   
                        Group 1 and group 2 will not have any interaction with each other on the 5th at night and 6th throughout the day. We are running a training 
                        exercise at those times.<br><br>
                        Group 2 is still expected to conduct themselves as gentlemen and always keep themselves in a self defense mindset at all times.<br><br>  
                        They way we do national rallies will change drastically over the course of the next couple months. After the 6th you will have to be part 
                        of group 1 to attend national events.

                In this Telegram post from <a href="https://sigsegv1980.github.io/j6/ProudBoys-MOSD-MAIN-FullChatMessages-2020-12-27_2021-1-1.pdf"><b>MOSD MAIN</b></a>,
                Proud Boy chairman <b>Enrique Tarrio</b> more or less spells out the agenda and objective for the (then upcoming) January 6th rally in Washington DC.
                He first establishes that the Proud Boys who attend the Jan 6 rally will be divided into two major groups. <b>Group 1</b> refers to the
                Proud Boys who are members of the newly established <b>“Ministry Of Self Defense”</b> (<b>MOSD</b>) chapter.
                <b>Group 2</b> refers to any other Proud Boys who are not members of <b>MOSD</b> but still wish to attend the Jan 6 rally in DC.
                <br><br>
                <b>Enrique Tarrio</b> explains that the <b>MOSD</b> Proud Boys (<b>Group 1</b>) will be <i><b>“running a training exercise”</b></i>
                throughout the day of January 6th. Clearly, <i>“running a training exercise”</i> is hardly equivalent to storming the
                Capitol. However, the prosecution would likely argue that <b>Tarrio</b> was intentionally obfuscating his true agenda
                for January 6th. But this is ultimately a case of <i>special pleading</i>, because the prosecution implicitly assumed that the
                Proud Boys who participated in these private, encrypted group chats on Telegram were expressing genuine beliefs whenever a Proud Boy said something
                that the prosecution considered incriminating.
                <br><br>
                Indeed, the body of Telegram evidence presented during the conspiracy trial
                consisted <i>entirely</i> of Telegram posts made in private, encrypted group chats that the Proud Boys believed to be secure (at least
                until January 4th, 2021, when <b>Enrique Tarrio</b> was 
                <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20220712213106/https://twitter.com/maustermuhle/status/1346521554855874565">arrested for an unrelated crime</a>). 
                Indeed, the Proud Boys regularly
                discussed <b><i>highly illegal</i></b> (but non-Capitol-storming-related) activities in these group chats, like
                participating in
                <a href="https://sigsegv1980.github.io/j6/ProudBoys-ExportedTelegramChatMOSDOp/messages.html#go_to_message489">violent street fights with <b>Antifa</b></a>
                or <a href="https://sigsegv1980.github.io/j6/ProudBoys-ExportedTelegramChatMOSDOp/messages.html#go_to_message533">illegally carrying a concealed knife</a>. 
                There is no evidence
                supporting the claim that any statements from the <b>MOSD</b> Telegram group chats were intentionally
                obfuscated or written in some kind of secret code language to conceal the true meaning. At best, the Proud Boys occasionally used the common
                Internet meme-phrase “<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20220720202033/https://www.reddit.com/r/legaladviceofftopic/comments/fzx93m/in_minecraft_meme/"><b><i>in minecraft</i></b></a>”
                as a humorously ironic <i>“wink-wink”</i> after bringing up certain illegal acts like
                getting into <a href="https://sigsegv1980.github.io/j6/ProudBoys-MOSD-Main-2020-12-27_2021-1-4.pdf#page=7">violent street battles with <b>Antifa</b></a>.
                <br><br>
                Furthermore, <b>Enrique Tarrio's</b> claim that the <b>MOSD</b> Proud Boys would be <b><i>“running a training exercise”</i></b> throughout
                the day of January 6th is <b><i>entirely consistent</i></b> with several other statements (from both Telegram and the private
                <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9HY3IVStIJc"><b>MOSD</b> Zoom meeting</a>) that also described the agenda for January 6th 
                as involving a <i><b>“test”</b></i> of some sort. For example, when elaborating on the organizational structure of the <b>MOSD</b> chapter,
                <b>Enrique Tarrio</b> said:
                <br><br>

                        If you’re planning on coming on the 6th you will have two choices. You're either in this group
                        or you're with your home chapter. Being with your home chapter will not disqualify you from
                        being in this group. Again the choice is yours. But we are going to be <b>using the 6th as a test</b>.

                This is also consistent with a conversation between <b>Enrique Tarrio</b> and <b>MOSD</b> leader <b>John Charles Stewart</b> 
                (a.k.a. <b>Johnny Blackbeard</b>) wherein <b>Tarrio</b> <a href="#anc2">alluded to a <b><i>“test run”</i></b></a> when answering <b>Johnny Blackbeard's</b>

                </div>
                When we synthesize <b>Enrique Tarrio's</b> description of the agenda for Jan 6 <i>“<a href="https://sigsegv1980.github.io/j6/ProudBoys-MOSD-MAIN-FullChatMessages-2020-12-27_2021-1-1.pdf#page=194"><b>as a test</b></a>”</i>
                involving <i>“<a href="https://sigsegv1980.github.io/j6/ProudBoys-MOSD-MAIN-FullChatMessages-2020-12-27_2021-1-1.pdf#page=118"><b>training exercises</b></a>”</i>
                with Tarrio's other statements about remaining 
                <i>“<a href="https://youtu.be/9HY3IVStIJc?t=1051"><b>as a nucleus</b></a>”</i> and 
                staying <i>“<a href="https://youtu.be/9HY3IVStIJc?t=1460"><b>as one fucking unit</b></a>”</i>, 
                Tarrio's <b>TRUE</b> plan for January 6th becomes pretty clear. It had nothing to do with
                some <b>seditious conspiracy</b> to storm the Capitol building. Rather, <b>Tarrio</b> essentially wanted to use the January 6 rally 
                to <b>field test</b> a march with the <b>MOSD</b> Proud Boys — to take the <b>MOSD</b> chapter for a spin in the streets of Washington DC. 
                This is also consistent with <b>Charles Donohoe</b>'s
                description of the plan for January 6th as 
                <i>“<a href="https://sigsegv1980.github.io/j6/ProudBoys-ExportedTelegramChatMOSDOp/messages.html#go_to_message441"><b>a simple and quick mission</b></a>”</i>.
                The objective was to 
                <a href="https://youtu.be/9HY3IVStIJc?t=1019">split the attending <b>MOSD</b> Proud Boys into smaller <b>ten-man squads</b></a> while maintaining a single overall marching 
                formation (“<a href="https://youtu.be/9HY3IVStIJc?t=1460"><b>stay as one fucking unit</b></a>” 
                and “<a href="https://youtu.be/9HY3IVStIJc?t=1051"><b>remain as a nucleus</b></a>”). 

                The stricter <b>MOSD</b> command structure 
                and rallying policies (e.g. <a href="https://youtu.be/9HY3IVStIJc?t=273">forbidding intoxication</a>) were intended to help leadership 
                coordinate the ten-man squads while maintaining a single 
                formation like a well-disciplined and unified infantry. 
                <br><br>
                Finally, <b>Tarrio's</b> long-term vision for the new <b>MOSD</b> chapter was that eventually 
                it would enable leadership to control and direct <i>thousands</i> of Proud Boys in a public march while maintaining formation and 
                ensuring discipline among the “rank and file”:

                Of course, many of the other events listed in this flyer were cancelled after hundreds of Trump supporters began storming the Capitol
                building in the early afternoon of January 6th.

                Apart from President Trump's speech, which was held at the Ellipse for security reasons, most of the official events scheduled 
                for the day of January 6th, 2021, were to be held near the US Capitol building. 
                For example, “<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20201223181220/https://latinosfortrump.us/"><b>Latinos For Trump</b></a>” had an 
                <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20210120221044/https://latinosfortrump.us/freedom-rally-jan-6">official event</a>
                located at <a href="https://sigsegv1980.github.io/j6/LatinosForTrumpJan6Flyer.pdf">“Area 7” on the Capitol grounds</a>
                from 10AM to 12PM on January 6. The organization that held the 
                <a href="https://sigsegv1980.github.io/j6/KylieKremer-Jan6PermitForWomenForAmericaFirst-Amended.pdf"><b>event permit</b> for the “main event”</a> (President
                Trump's speech at the Ellipse) was a non-profit called 
                “<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20210103044344/https://twitter.com/america1stwomen"><b>Women For America First</b></a>”.
                This same non-profit also organized and held the event permits for the “main events” during both earlier “<b>Million MAGA March</b>” rallies 
                held on <a href="https://sigsegv1980.github.io/j6/CindyChafian-November14PermitForWomenForAmericaFirst.pdf"><b>November 14th</b></a> 
                and <a href="https://sigsegv1980.github.io/j6/CindyChafian-December12PermitForWomenForAmericaFirst.pdf"><b>December 12th</b></a> in 2020. However,
                neither of these earlier DC-based MAGA rallies featured a speech from President Trump, so in both cases the “main event”
                was instead held in <b>Freedom Plaza</b>, a public open area located 
                <a href="https://www.google.com/maps/dir/U.S.+Capitol+Building,+Washington,+DC/Freedom+Plaza,+Washington,+DC+20004/@38.8930231,-77.0235588,16z/data=!4m14!4m13!1m5!1m1!1s0x89b7b82921a2cf17:0x482a3f7c10cf8c4!2m2!1d-77.0090505!2d38.8899389!1m5!1m1!1s0x89b7b79783bf893d:0x203e2fe928efb537!2m2!1d-77.0307214!2d38.8958434!3e2?entry=ttu&g_ep=EgoyMDI1MDEwNy4wIKXMDSoASAFQAw%3D%3D">about

                <br><br>
                The Proud Boys had attended both earlier “<b>Million MAGA March</b>” rallies in November and December of 2020. Both of these
                earlier rallies featured a “main event” that began with a “<a href="https://sigsegv1980.github.io/j6/CindyChafian-December12PermitForWomenForAmericaFirst.pdf"><b>freedom 
                of speech rally</b></a>” held at <b>Freedom Plaza</b>, followed by
                a <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20201114160836/https://video.parler.com/4v/ga/4vga86G6g0Pq.mp4">march from <b>Freedom Plaza</b> to 
                the US Supreme Court</a>. These earlier event programs were significantly <i>different</i>
                than the official event program for January 6th, which instead
                featured a “main event” (President Trump's speech) located at the Ellipse and 
                various <a href="https://sigsegv1980.github.io/j6/USCapitolPolicePermitsForEventsNearCapitol.pdf">lesser events to be held
                near the US Capitol building</a>.
                <br><br>
                With this in mind, note that in the Telegram posts quoted in the left column, Proud Boy “<b>Travis Vancouver PB</b>” asked
                where the main events on January 6 were to be located, and a Michigan Proud Boy using the Telegram handle “<b>Redman</b>”
                responded by informing “<b>Travis Vancouver PB</b>” that the Michigan Proud Boys would be located in <b>Freedom Plaza</b> on Jan 6.
                Presumably, <b>Redman</b> (incorrectly) believed that the “main event” on January 6th was to be held in <b>Freedom Plaza</b>. At the time,
                this was a perfectly reasonable assumption on <b>Redman's</b> part, because at <i><b>BOTH earlier DC MAGA rallies</b></i>
                the “main event” was located in <b>Freedom Plaza</b>. 
                <br><br>
                This Telegram conversation took place on December 29th, 2020. While this was little more than a week before January 6th,
                the official event program for the Jan 6 rally was still in flux, as President Trump had not yet officially announced
                he would be giving a speech at the Ellipse. (That announcement finally
                <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20210103160805/https://twitter.com/realDonaldTrump/status/1345753534168506370">occurred on January 3rd, 2021</a>).
                Thus, on December 29th, 2020, “<b>Redman</b>” had no way of knowing that the “main event” would later be relocated
                to the Ellipse. However, even as early as December 29, there were
                <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20201228183027/https://wildprotest.com/">event flyers available</a> announcing that many
                of the official events scheduled for the Jan 6 rally would be held near the <b>US Capitol building</b>. This concentration
                of official events around the Capitol (instead of <b>Freedom Plaza</b> like the earlier rallies) is a result of the 
                special significance of January 6th as the date when Congress certifies the Electoral Votes. 
                <br><br>
                Thus, “<b>Redman</b>”
                either incorrectly assumed the “main event” would be held in <b>Freedom Plaza</b> (a reasonable assumption, since
                events at previous MAGA rallies were held there), or he simply didn't care about
                the “main event” and was planning to congregate with his chapter in <b>Freedom Plaza</b> for whatever reason. 
                But recall that the prosecution claimed the Proud Boys conspired <i>in advance</i> of January 6th to storm
                the US Capitol, and furthermore that the <b>MOSD</b> chapter was created <i>specifically</i> to plan
                such an attack. Therefore, according to the prosecution, the Proud Boys began conspiring to storm the Capitol
                at least as early as <b>December 20th, 2020</b>, when the <a href="https://sigsegv1980.github.io/j6/ProudBoys-MOSDChat-2020-12-20_2021-1-4.pdf">
                <b>MOSD</b> leadership Telegram group chat</a> (Govt Exhibit <b>501-1</b>) was first created. Therefore, by December 29th, the basic
                details of this <b>secret seditious plan</b> should have already been known within the <b>MOSD</b> chapter. And yet <b>Redman</b> 
                is seemingly oblivious to any such conspiracy, instead
                planning to counter-productively spend January 6th in <b>Freedom Plaza</b> with his entire chapter, over a mile away from the 
                Capitol building
                he's supposed to be storming.
                <br><br>
                Perhaps <b>Redman</b> simply wasn't “in the loop” at this time. He wasn't an upper-tier <b>MOSD</b> leader, so perhaps
                he simply wasn't told about this secret <b>seditious plan</b> to attack the Capitol yet. But surely,
                <b>Enrique Tarrio</b> — the Chairman of the Proud Boys and founder of the <b>MOSD</b> chapter — would be 
                “in the loop” by December 29th, 2020. But <b>Enrique Tarrio</b>
                seems to have read the exchange between <b>Redman</b> and <b>Travis Vancouver PB</b> on Telegram, yet remained
                inexplicably silent about <b>Redman</b>'s decision to spend January 6th in <b>Freedom Plaza</b> with 
                the entire Michigan chapter. If <b>Tarrio</b> was secretly planning to orchestrate an attack on the Capitol
                building, he should have informed <b>Redman</b> and <b>Travis Vancouver PB</b> that the official events 
                on January 6 would be located near the Capitol building. <b>Tarrio</b>
                could have explained this without giving away any details about a hypothetical conspiracy, since many of the
                official events for the Jan 6 rally <i>actually were</i> located near the Capitol.
                Yet <b>Tarrio</b> apparently said nothing about this, instead merely reminding <b>Redman</b>
                to make sure that the other Michigan Proud Boys join the <b>MOSD MAIN</b> group chat on Telegram.
                <br><br>
                Once again, it is more likely that no secret plan to storm the Capitol building ever actually existed, at least
                not on or before December 29th, 2020.

                In this Telegram discussion, two <b>MOSD</b> leaders, <b>Rabbi “Ash” Asher Barkoziba</b> (yes one of the Proud Boys
                was a Rabbi) and <b>John Charles Stewart</b> (a.k.a <b>Johnny Blackbeard</b>) discuss the new <b>MOSD</b> policy
                (<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20201229170859/https://parler.com/post/c741b78505a54150bdf63d079952e8f0">announced publicly on Parler</a> by <b>Enrique Tarrio</b>)
                forbidding members of the <b>MOSD</b> from wearing traditional black and yellow Proud Boy group colors at rallies in favor of
                wearing all black in order to avoid being identified and/or to 
                <a href="https://sigsegv1980.github.io/j6/ProudBoys-ExportedTelegramChatMOSDOp/messages.html#go_to_message163">blend in with <b>Antifa</b></a>.
                <b>Ash Barkoziba</b> expressed the concern that without any identifying colors, individual Proud Boys
                might <i>“get lost and find themselves alone if we don't have some distinguishing mark”</i>. <b>Ash</b> suggested
                wearing some <i>secret</i> distinguishing mark, like a bandana around the neck,
                so that individual Proud Boys would be able to easily identify other Proud Boys while on the ground in DC. 
                <br><br>
                But <b>Johnny Blackbeard</b> countered that individual Proud Boys should
                never find themselves lost in the first place, because if such a thing were to happen, it means <i>“this entire thing”</i>
                — i.e. the “<b>Ministry Of Self Defense</b>” (<b>MOSD</b>) chapter — has failed. <b>Johnny Blackbeard</b>'s point
                here is consistent with the <a href="#anc4">stated purpose of the <b>MOSD</b></a>, as a new national-level chapter with a 
                <a href="https://sigsegv1980.github.io/j6/ProudBoys-MOSD-MAIN-FullChatMessages-2020-12-27_2021-1-1.pdf#page=279">stricter
                command structure</a>, designed to ensure the Proud Boys remain <a href="https://youtu.be/9HY3IVStIJc?t=2161">marching in formation</a> as
                <i>“<b><a href="https://youtu.be/9HY3IVStIJc?t=1460">one fucking unit</a></b>”</i>, and nobody
                ever <a href="https://youtu.be/9HY3IVStIJc?t=2015">runs off</a>, gets lost or breaks formation.
                <br><br>
                However, the prosecution argued that the primary purpose of the <b>MOSD</b> chapter was actually to secretly devise
                plans to storm the Capitol building, and furthermore, that all preparations made by the Proud Boys in advance of January 6th
                (e.g. wearing body armor or dressing incognito) where in fact all part of the secret conspiracy to storm the Capitol.
                The prosecution's argument is refuted by a <a href="#anc4">large body of Telegram evidence demostrating the true purpose of the
                <b>MOSD</b></a> chapter: to 
                address <a href="https://sigsegv1980.github.io/j6/ProudBoys-OfficialPresidentsChat-2020-8-7_2020-12-31.pdf#page=17">disciplinary issues</a> 
                that <a href="https://youtu.be/9HY3IVStIJc?t=438">arose during a previous MAGA rally</a> in Washington DC and make it easier for the Proud Boy leadership
                to <a href="https://youtu.be/9HY3IVStIJc?t=1384">direct and control large numbers of Proud Boys</a> during public marches.
                The Telegram exchange quoted here in the left column is yet more evidence refuting the prosecution's claim about the purpose of the <b>MOSD</b>.
                <br><br>
                Firstly, <b>Johnny Blackbeard</b>'s response to <b>Ash Barkoziba</b> is consistent with <b>Johnny Blackbeard</b>'s understanding
                of the true purpose of the <b>MOSD</b>. The <b>MOSD</b> chapter was established with a stricter command structure designed
                to keep the “rank and file” Proud Boys in line during marches and ensure everyone marches together 
                as <i>“<b><a href="https://youtu.be/9HY3IVStIJc?t=1460">one fucking unit</a></b>”</i>. Thus, <b>as Johnny Blackbeard</b> argued,
                additional measures — like some kind of distinguishing mark to help individual Proud Boys identify each other — should
                be unnecesssary, because the <i>entire point</i> of the <b>MOSD</b> was to keep everyone together in a single formation.
                <br><br>
                <b>Ash Barkoziba</b> counters <b>Johnny Blackbeard</b>'s point by arguing that 
                individual Proud Boys are liable to get lost during marches even <i>with</i> the new <b>MOSD</b> command structure, because 
                <i>“it has happened and will happen, some guy goes to take a piss and before you know he’s marching with antifa”</i>. But
                <b>Ash Barkoziba</b>'s hypothetical example of a possible bad outcome — i.e. <i>“<b>some guy goes to take a piss and before you know he’s marching with antifa</b>”</i>
                — strongly suggests that <b>Ash Barkoziba</b>'s was operating under the assumption that January 6th would play out
                very similarly to previous MAGA rallies in Washington DC. That is, <b>Ash</b> expected the January 6th rally to involve
                <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20201114160836/https://video.parler.com/4v/ga/4vga86G6g0Pq.mp4">marching</a> and 
                <a href="https://youtu.be/yOeMrBGS1n8?t=139">fighting with <b>Antifa</b></a>, just like the events of previous MAGA rallies in D.C. the Proud Boys had attended
                earlier in <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20201118012633/https://www.washingtonpost.com/dc-md-va/2020/11/14/million-maga-march-dc-protests/">November</a>

                <br><br>
                <b>Ash's</b> comment makes much less sense if he expected to spend January 6th storming the Capitol. Why would <b>Ash</b> be concerned
                about Proud Boys accidentally ending up <i>“<b>marching with antifa</b> [after going to take a piss]”</i>, if Jan 6 was
                supposed to center around some secret plan to storm the Capitol and attack the police?
                The conversation here between <b>Ash</b> and <b>Johnny Blackbeard</b> leaves no room for any secret conspiracy to
                storm the Capitol building. Rather, the conversation is consistent with the large body of Telegram evidence
                that indicates the true purpose of the <b>MOSD</b> chapter was simply to

                Here, a <b>MOSD</b> Proud Boy using the Telegram handle “<b>RedBeard… THE Original</b>”
                expresses the belief that <i>“most of the events [on Jan 6] will be centered around <b>freedom plaza</b>”</i>. 
                This post constitutes further evidence that a little over a week before January 6th, the <b>MOSD</b> Proud Boys (or at least <i>some of them</i>) 
                evidently had no idea about any plan to storm the Capitol, and still mistakenly believed that the

                <b>Freedom Plaza</b></a>, rather than the Capitol building or the Ellipse where they were <i>actually</i> held. This was a 
                reasonable mistake to make, because at the time of this post many of 
                the <a href="https://sigsegv1980.github.io/j6/USCapitolPolicePermitsForEventsNearCapitol.pdf">official events planned for the Jan 6 rally</a> 
                were still in flux, as <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20210103160805/https://twitter.com/realDonaldTrump/status/1345753534168506370">President Trump's speech 
                at the Ellipse</a> had not yet
                been announced. Since the previous MAGA rallies in Washington DC (in 
                <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20201118012633/https://www.washingtonpost.com/dc-md-va/2020/11/14/million-maga-march-dc-protests/">November</a>

                of 2020) were in fact 
                <a href="https://sigsegv1980.github.io/j6/CindyChafian-December12PermitForWomenForAmericaFirst.pdf">centered
                around <b>Freedom Plaza</b></a>, it makes perfect sense that the Proud Boys might mistakenly believe (as of December 29th, 2020
                when this Telegram conversation occurred) the Jan 6 rally would take place in <b>Freedom Plaza</b>. This constitutes further
                evidence that many of the <b>MOSD</b> Proud Boys were operating under the assumption that January 6 would play out 
                similarly to previous MAGA rallies, which entailed <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20201114160836/https://video.parler.com/4v/ga/4vga86G6g0Pq.mp4"><b>a march</b></a> from 
                <a href="https://sigsegv1980.github.io/j6/CindyChafian-December12PermitForWomenForAmericaFirst.pdf"><b>Freedom Plaza</b> to the Supreme Court</a>, and thus had
                nothing to do with the US Capitol building.
                <br><br>
                Of course, the Proud Boy who posted this was not an upper-tier <b>MOSD</b> leader, just a “rank and file” Proud Boy.
                So it's possible that this individual was simply not “in the loop” and therefore was not yet told about the secret
                plan to storm the Capitol. Indeed, about 15 minutes after “<b>RedBeard… THE Original</b>” posted, <b>Enrique Tarrio</b> 
                chimed in to inform <b>Redbeard</b> that the main events on Jan 6 will actually be held near the Capitol,
                not <b>Freedom Plaza</b>. But this is in
                contrast to a <a href="#anc11">similar Telegram exchange</a> (also in 
                <a href="https://sigsegv1980.github.io/j6/ProudBoys-MOSD-MAIN-FullChatMessages-2020-12-27_2021-1-1.pdf#page=146"><b>MOSD MAIN</b></a>) 
                which happened about 10 hours before the conversation quoted here. Except in the prior conversation, <b>Enrique Tarrio</b> 
                did <i>NOT</i> bother to correct the misinformed Proud Boy who mistakenly believed the official events would take
                place in <b>Freedom Plaza</b>, even though <b>Tarrio</b> otherwise continued to participate in the conversation.
                <br><br>
                On December 29th, 2020, when the Telegram conversation quoted in the left column happened, the

                the Jan 6 rally was still in flux in terms of 
                <a href="https://sigsegv1980.github.io/j6/USCapitolPolicePermitsForEventsNearCapitol.pdf">time slots, stage locations, and guest speakers</a>, due to a
                confusing 
                <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20210130155615/https://www.propublica.org/article/trump-campaign-fundraiser-ellipse-rally">power struggle
                between different event organizers</a>. <b>Enrique Tarrio</b> himself also  
                <a href="https://sigsegv1980.github.io/j6/ProudBoys-MOSDChat-2020-12-20_2021-1-4.pdf#page=32">expressed confusion over event locations</a> and time slots. (See also the

                and <a href="https://sigsegv1980.github.io/j6/Jan6Committee-DepositionOfBrandonStraka.pdf#page=20">Brandon Straka</a>
                for evidence of the confusion over event planning, especially from December 26-28, 2020). 
                <br><br>
                Early <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20201223062953/https://wildprotest.com/">event flyers</a> announcing
                some of the scheduled events for Jan 6 had begun to circulate around the online MAGA-sphere at this point, and it's therefore likely
                that <b>Enrique Tarrio</b> had just become aware, within the ten hour period preceding this Telegram conversation,
                that many of the official events for the Jan 6 rally would be held at stages
                <a href="https://sigsegv1980.github.io/j6/USCapitolPolicePermitsForEventsNearCapitol.pdf">near the <b>Capitol building</b></a>. 
                Additionally, in the Telegram conversation quoted in the left column, <b>Enrique Tarrio</b> was also aware that
                President Trump might give a speech at the Jan 6 rally, which could <i>“wreck everyone's plans”</i>. 
                And in fact, this is exactly what happened: many guest speakers originally booked to speak at 
                the Jan 6 rally had their <a href="https://sigsegv1980.github.io/j6/Jan6Committee-DepositionOfAmyKremer.pdf#page=83">speeches cancelled</a> after  
                <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20210103160805/https://twitter.com/realDonaldTrump/status/1345753534168506370">
                President Trump's speech at the Ellipse was announced</a> officially
                on January 3rd, 2021.
                <br><br>
                What's noteworthy about the quoted Telegram conversation is that none of the <b>MOSD</b> Proud Boys, including
                <b>Enrique Tarrio</b>, seem to express any interest in the Capitol building <i>specifically</i>, beyond the fact that the 
                <a href="https://sigsegv1980.github.io/j6/Jan6MAGARallyMapGuideFull.pdf"><b>official events</b></a>
                for the Jan 6 rally were <a href="https://sigsegv1980.github.io/j6/USCapitolPolicePermitsForEventsNearCapitol.pdf">originally centered around the Capitol</a>
                before 
                <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20210103160805/https://twitter.com/realDonaldTrump/status/1345753534168506370">
                President Trump's speech at the <b>Ellipse</b></a> became the main event. Furthermore, 
                multiple <b>MOSD</b> members originally assumed (incorrectly) that the Jan 6 rally would 
                <a href="#anc11">take place at <b>Freedom Plaza</b></a>,
                and seemingly had no interest in the Capitol at all. And even <b>Enrique Tarrio</b>, after informing another Proud Boy
                that the rally would be centered around the Capitol building instead of <b>Freedom Plaza</b>, expressed no specific interest
                in the Capitol beyond its role as a venue for the 
                <a href="https://sigsegv1980.github.io/j6/Jan6MAGARallyMapGuideFull.pdf"><b>official events</b></a> scheduled for Jan 6. Indeed,
                <b>Tarrio</b> was concerned 
                about the possibility that President Trump might <i>“<b>wreck everyone's plans and make his own stage</b>”</i>, i.e. force 
                other guest speakers to relocate or reschedule their speeches around Trump's
                event — which is <a href="https://sigsegv1980.github.io/j6/Jan6Committee-DepositionOfAmyKremer.pdf#page=83">exactly what happened</a>. 
                <br><br>
                <b>Enrique Tarrio</b> was concerned about this because some Proud Boys in his chapter were signed up to provide <b><i>personal security details</i></b>
                (Proud Boys sometimes <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20201115132417/https://weartv.com/news/local/proud-boys-provide-security-at-pro-america-rally-in-milton">

                for the guest speakers at

                “Area 7” near the Capitol building from 10 AM to 12 PM on January 6.

                In these Telegram posts, a <b>MOSD</b> Proud Boy using the Telegram handle “<b>Vito (il Duce) Russo</b>” comments
                on the new <b>MOSD</b> “incognito dress code” — that is, the new <b>MOSD</b> policy prohibiting the wearing of official yellow and black 
                Proud Boy colors to the
                Jan 6 rally. The prosecution argued that the Proud Boys dressed incognito on January 6 as part of a
                secret plan to attack the police and storm the Capitol building. But the Telegram evidence demonstrates
                conclusively that the decision to dress incognito on January 6th had nothing at all to do with  
                some secret plan to storm the Capitol. Rather, the “incognito dress code” was almost entirely connected to the Proud Boys' expectation of violent
                conflict with <i>anti-fascist</i> counter-protesters (<b>Antifa</b>) in the streets of Washington D.C. on January 6th.

                The Telegram posts from “<b>Vito (il Duce) Russo</b>”, quoted here in the left column, 
                are yet more evidence that the <b>MOSD</b> Proud Boys viewed
                their plan to dress incognito on January 6th as part of their strategy to engage

                and <i>“beat[ing] the motherfuck out of them”</i>. Clearly, the Proud Boys' new incognito
                dress code had nothing to do with any secret plan to storm the Capitol building, and was
                primarily related to the anticipated conflict with <b>Antifa</b>.

                In this Telegram conversation, <b>MOSD</b> leader <b>Richard Schwetz</b> (a.k.a. “<b>Dick Sweats</b>”), leader of
                the Philadelphia Proud Boys, expressed confusion
                over the new <b>MOSD</b> policy prohibiting the wearing of traditional Proud Boy colors (black and yellow) to the
                Jan 6 rally. <b>Dick Sweats</b> was confused over the origin or purpose of this new rule. It seems some
                Proud Boys in the <b>MOSD</b> chapter were under the impression that this <i>“no colors”</i> rule was established
                because the local Washington D.C. chapter of the Proud Boys had requested it and the other chapters agreed
                to honor this request. But <B>Joe Biggs</b> or other upper-tier <b>MOSD</b> leaders apparently said things
                suggesting the new rule was a tactical decision made by the upper-tier <b>MOSD</b> leaders.
                <br><br>
                Finally, <b>Jeremy Bertino</b>, an upper-tier <b>MOSD</b> leader, chimed in to say that the origin of the <i>“no colors”</i> rule
                doesn't matter, because the rule itself would give the Proud Boys a major tactical advantage over <b>Antifa</b>.
                <br><br>
                This Telegram conversation is further evidence refuting the prosecution's claim that the purpose of the <b>MOSD</b> chapter,
                along with the new <i>“no colors”</i> policy established as part of the <b>MOSD</b>, was established primarily to 
                make a plan to attack the police and storm the Capitol. (Presumably, the prosecution believed the <i>“no colors”</i> rule
                was intended to make it easier for the Proud Boys to conceal their identity from the police while attacking
                the Capitol.) But this Telegram conversation reveals that (A) many <b>MOSD</b> Proud Boys had no idea what the
                purpose of this rule actually was, and (B) upper-tier <b>MOSD</b> leaders like <b>Jeremy Bertino</b> (who would be more “in the know”
                about such things) clearly believed the <i>“no colors”</i> rule was established primarily as a tactical strategy
                to mitigate the anticipated street fights with <b>Antifa</b> that the Proud Boys 
                <a href="#anc2">believed would happen on January 6</a> in the streets of Washington DC.
                <br><br>
                The Proud Boys had good reasons to expect
                violent conflict with <b>Antifa</b> on January 6, because this is exactly what happened during the two previous
                <b>“Million MAGA March”</b> rallies in DC on

                        I seen this a few times at DC2. I spent more time holding mother fuckers back than I did

                        I hate when there is just one dude on the sidewalk barking at us and 30 PBs break rank to go engage. THE COPS WATCH US ALL DAY. THE MEDIA ORBITS US LIKE SATELLITES
                        AROUND EARTH. Im not saying that we should never engage, but we need strict rules of

                was to devise a secret plan to storm the Capitol on January 6th. In reality, the Telegram evidence

                that includes new policies designed to enhance 
                discipline (e.g. <a href="https://youtu.be/9HY3IVStIJc?t=273">forbidding intoxication</a>) and 
                <a href="https://youtu.be/9HY3IVStIJc?t=438">improve the way rallies are conducted</a>, in order to avoid the debacle that happened

                altercation with a counter-protester</a>. 
                <b>Enrique Tarrio</b> blamed this disaster on a <a href="https://youtu.be/9HY3IVStIJc?t=438">breakdown of discipline</a> and a 
                <a href="https://sigsegv1980.github.io/j6/ProudBoys-OfficialPresidentsChat-2020-8-7_2020-12-31.pdf#page=17">failure to follow orders</a>,

                <br><br>
                The fundamental problem
                was that during marches, individual Proud Boys often got distracted by nearby counter-protesters or hecklers and would therefore
                frequently break formation in order to run off and confront or attack a random counter-protester:

                The primary purpose of the <b>MOSD</b> chapter was simply to get 
                <a href="https://sigsegv1980.github.io/j6/ProudBoys-MOSD-MAIN-FullChatMessages-2020-12-27_2021-1-1.pdf#page=279">better organized and fix this situation</a>. It
                had nothing to do with any secret plan to storm the Capitol building. The Telegram conversation quoted here in the left column
                constitutes further evidence of this. A Proud Boy using the Telegram handle “<b>Redman aka Saint Christopher of CapCity</b>” complained
                that during the <a href="https://nypost.com/2020/12/12/proud-boys-anti-trump-protesters-tangle-in-dc-as-daytime-rallies-end/">December 12th, 2020, rally in D.C.</a>
                he <i>“spent more time holding mother fuckers back than I did
                jawjacking with Antifa”</i>, i.e., he spent more time trying to prevent Proud Boys from breaking formation than he spent
                actually fighting with <b>Antifa</b> (the Proud Boys viewed <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20201212160329/https://www.capradio.org/articles/2020/12/05/antifa-protesters-confront-pro-trump-demonstrators-proud-boys-at-californias-capitol-violence-ensues/">
                street fights with <b>Antifa</b></a> as an expected feature of their
                rallies and marches throughout 2020). <b>Redman</b> adds that he was rewarded with <i>“free hot sauce”</i> (i.e. pepper spray, from either
                counter-protesters or the cops) for his efforts to keep the “rank-and-file” Proud Boys under control.
                <br><br>
                Another Proud Boy, using the Telegram handle “<b>Pedro (Q-Tip) Homelander</b>” chimed in, concurring with <b>Redman</b>
                and adding <i>“That’s how people got stabbed. One guy saying shit and 30 [Proud Boys] go after him. We cannot be the aggressor like that.”</i> In other words,
                according to <b>Pedro</b>, the problem was that often <i>“one guy”</i> (i.e. some random counter-protester on the sidelines) would
                say some shit (i.e. say something to provoke
                from the sidelines) and then <i>“30 pbs go after him”</i> (i.e. multiple Proud Boys would insubordinately break formation to run off and attack the
                heckling counter-protester).
                <br><br>
                <b>Pedro</b>'s lament pretty much encapsulates the entire purpose of the <b>MOSD</b> as a chapter
                with stricter rules and a more militaristic command structure. This is entirely consistent with
                <b>Enrique Tarrio</b>'s <a href="https://youtu.be/9HY3IVStIJc?t=2161">many complaints</a> about 
                <a href="https://sigsegv1980.github.io/j6/ProudBoys-OfficialPresidentsChat-2020-8-7_2020-12-31.pdf#page=17">
                lack of discipline</a> and breaking formation during marches. It's also consistent with <b>Tarrio</b>'s 
                emphasis on the theme of <a href="https://youtu.be/9HY3IVStIJc?t=473"><b><i>self defense</i></b></a> — hence the name <i>“<b>Ministry Of Self Defense</b>”</i> (<b>MOSD</b>) — as opposed
                to losing control and going on the <i>offense</i> at the slightest provocation.

                Aaron's statement is entirely consistent with <b>Enrique Tarrio</b>'s clearly stated purpose of

                Another <b>MOSD</b> leader, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20201119023515/https://parler.com/profile/DickSweats"><b>Richard Schwetz</b></a>, 
                leader of a Pennsylvania chapter of Proud Boys, chimed in to
                express agreement with <b>Aaron Wolkind</b>'s post. <b>Richard Schwetz</b> then added that he was 
                <i>“glad that we are all going to work on doing better for everyone [in the MOSD group chat]”</i>, expressing
                his belief that the discussions in the <b>MOSD MAIN</b> group chat would ultimately result in 
                <i>“the betterment of the entire fraternity”</i>. This is also entirely consistent with <b>Enrique Tarrio</b>'s

                whom the Proud Boy leadership <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20210110204254/https://rumble.com/vcbz9d-rebel-talk-episode-2.html">believed was affiliated
                with a local <b>Antifa</b> group</a>.
                <br><br>
                <b>Enrique Tarrio</b> <i>clearly</i> stated that the purpose of the <b>MOSD</b> chapter was to

                along with new policies (e.g. <a href="https://youtu.be/9HY3IVStIJc?t=273">forbidding intoxication</a>) intended to ensure the sort of

                Therefore, much of the discussion
                throughout the <b>MOSD MAIN</b> group chat involved spitballing ideas for making sure nobody
                breaks formation and everyone remains together during public marches. The Telegram posts quoted here in the left column are examples
                of some ideas spitballed by various <b>MOSD</b> Proud Boys throughout the evening of December 30th, 2020.

                In one of these posts, <b>MOSD</b> leader “<b>Travis Vancouver PB</b>” emphasizes the importance of <i>“<b>polic[ing] our own</b>”</i>

                        In the [Pacific Northwest Chapter] we have always made it very clear we only stop and aggress or talk too if [counter-protesters or hecklers]

                at rallies. <b>Travis'</b> claim that he <i>“spend[s] more time policing our own than anything”</i> is consistent with statements
                from other Proud Boys in the <b>MOSD MAIN</b> group chat, such as the post from “<b>Redman</b>” stating that 
                <i>“I spent more time holding mother fuckers back than I did jawjacking with Antifa”</i>. All of
                this is consistent with <a href="https://sigsegv1980.github.io/j6/ProudBoys-SkullAndBonesChat-2020-9-29_2021-1-4.pdf#page=10"><b>Enrique Tarrio</b>'s

                as several <b>MOSD</b> Proud Boys spit-balled
                ideas and shared experiences to come up with ways to keep everyone together in formation during
                public marches and to discourage undisciplined Proud Boys from running off and going rogue. Again, these discussions

                        10 man squad, the reason we're picking 10 instead of others is you can count the 10 on your two hands,
                        so if you're that squad leader, you can't, you only count 9, you're fucked up.

                        thing of this is, you know, with a thousand Proud Boys in DC, you know, we were together sometimes,
                        we're all over the place sometimes, but there was no way to control, you know, um, there's no control
                        over that. So <b>hopefully with this, with this new structure in place, what we'll be able to do is, it'll give us the

                        — and now you have 700 guys going, you know, two blocks over, just because they see the guy next to him moving.
                        You know, now
                        we'll have a little bit more
                        control where we can send elements in different directions and different places to do different things
                        and not necessarily in
                        an offensive manner, but just generally speaking, so we can have that that kind of

                        something that we all need to talk about, but the escalation of force — <b>obviously we're the ministry of
                        self-defense, so escalation of force isn't going to be to go out and attack</b>. Um, <b>it's going to be
                        more of like a bodyguard system</b>. So obviously we'll be around
                        the marketing team, a.k.a. the dudes that get
                        all the press and stuff like that, and basically be a bodyguard service for the mission that they're trying

                        But that being said, there's also going to be smaller teams that go out and do things
                        like recon and quick reaction force in case somebody gets jammed up in a bind, and also to provide
                        information back to that main element. So as of now, I think we all agree on

                On December 30th, 2020, <b>Enrique Tarrio</b> held a video conference and Q&A session over Zoom (hereafter referred to as
                the <b>MOSD Zoom meeting</b>) to discuss the
                newly established <b>Ministry Of Self Defense</b> (<b>MOSD</b>) chapter of the Proud Boys. The entire conference 
                is available on video, lasting about one hour and thirty-eight minutes. A <a href="https://sigsegv1980.github.io/j6/ProudBoys-2020-12-30-MOSDZoomMeetingTranscript.pdf">
                <b>complete transcript</b></a> of the meeting is
                also available. Here, I present the <i>entire video</i> 
                of this Zoom meeting as a major piece of <b><i>exculpatory evidence</i></b>.
                <br><br>
                During the conspiracy trial, the prosecution claimed that the <i>primary purpose</i> of the <b>MOSD</b> chapter was to
                devise in secret a plan to storm the Capitol building on January 6th, 2021. However, throughout the entire
                duration of the one hour and thirty-eight minute <b>MOSD Zoom meeting</b>, there was never <i>any</i> discussion of a
                plan to storm the Capitol. Indeed, there was not a single mention of <i>anything</i>
                even remotely resembling a plan to storm the Capitol. Yet the <b>MOSD Zoom meeting</b>
                was held about a week before January 6th and involved the senior-most Proud Boy leaders (many of whom would
                later end up as defendants in the <b><i>seditious conspiracy</i></b> trial) including <b>Enrique Tarrio</b>
                and <b>Joe Biggs</b>, and featured in-depth discussions about the purpose of the <b>MOSD</b> chapter.
                <br><br>
                The long duration of the Zoom session and the direct involvement of senior leadership, combined with the <i>temporal
                proximity</i> to January 6th, suggests that <i>if</i> any conspiracy to storm the Capitol actually existed,
                the <b>MOSD Zoom meeting</b> is one place we'd expect to find clear evidence of such a conspiracy.
                And yet we find absolutely nothing. (I strongly encourage readers to 
                <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9HY3IVStIJc">watch the whole video for themselves</a> and draw
                their own conclusions.)
                <br><br>
                Indeed, the <b>MOSD Zoom meeting</b> was such a compelling piece of
                <b>exculpatory evidence</b> that even a 
                <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20220626172210/https://www.nytimes.com/2022/06/26/us/politics/proud-boys-jan-6.html">
                New York Times journalist</a> (who overall seemed to side with the prosecution) conceded that the meeting video
                <i>“makes no mention of any planning that might have occurred in the week 
                directly before the Capitol attack”</i> and that <i>“just one week before [January 6]”</i> the <b>MOSD</b>
                leadership mostly discussed mundane things like <i>“staying away from alcohol and women 
                and taking measures to ensure their own security”</i>.
                <br><br>
                In the left column I list chronologically several transcribed statements (with timestamps) made during the <b>MOSD Zoom meeting</b>
                that exemplify the most significant takeaways that help to debunk the prosecution's claim that the <b>MOSD</b> chapter
                was created primarily to plan an attack on the Capitol building. This selection of transcribed statements helps
                to establish the <b><i>true</i></b> purpose of the <b>MOSD</b> chapter <i>and</i> the Proud Boys' <b><i>actual</i></b> plan for
                January 6th, 2021. (Much of this has already been
                discussed above in the <a href="#anc4">section analyzing the true purpose of the <b>MOSD</b> chapter</a>.)
                <br><br>
                <hr>
                <br>
                Firstly, the creation of the <b>MOSD</b> chapter had <i><b>nothing</b></i> to do with storming the Capitol on January 6th. Rather, 
                the <b>MOSD</b> chapter was created within a <i>very specific</i> historical context as a <i><b>direct reaction</b></i>
                to a <i>specific</i> historical event. On Saturday, December 12th, 2020, the Proud Boys attended the 
                “<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20201212160205/https://www.nbcwashington.com/news/local/trump-supporters-maga-rally-protest-dc-saturday/2506267/"><b>Million MAGA March</b></a>”
                rally in Washington DC. The rally ended in disaster after four Proud Boys — including <b>MOSD</b> leader <b>Jeremy Bertino</b> (a.k.a. <b>NobleBeard</b>) — 
                <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20201213043848/https://www.the-sun.com/news/1959359/million-maga-march-dc-trump-steal-election-stabbing/"><b>were stabbed</b></a> 
                and <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20201215100630/https://parler.com/post/dc61a2ca792b4e01ba66f74022c71a9b">subsequently <b>hospitalized</b></a>
                following an <a href="https://mpdc.dc.gov/release/arrest-made-assault-dangerous-weapon-knife-offense-500-block-11th-street-northwest">altercation with a counter-protester</a> 
                outside a bar. <b>Enrique Tarrio</b> blamed this disaster on the overall chaos that resulted from <i>undisciplined</i> and <i>insubordinate</i>
                Proud Boys who disregarded orders and broke formation to run off and attack random counter-protesters or hecklers
                on the sidelines as the Proud Boys marched through the streets of Washington DC. See timestamps
                <a href="https://youtu.be/9HY3IVStIJc?t=438"><b>7:18</b></a> (<i>“we fucked up on the 12th”</i>), 
                and <a href="https://youtu.be/9HY3IVStIJc?t=1704"><b>28:24</b></a> (<i>“we all saw what happened ... on the 12th in DC, we were really disorganized”</i>).
                <br><br>
                Thus, <b>Enrique Tarrio</b> insisted that <i>“<b>we need a way to do rallies better</b>”</i> (timestamp <a href="https://youtu.be/9HY3IVStIJc?t=438"><b>7:18</b></a>).
                <b>Tarrio</b> believed that the fundamental problem was the Proud Boys' inability to stay together in formation like a professional infantry
                during public marches. <b>Tarrio</b> lamented that during the march through DC on December 12, many “rank and file”
                Proud Boys broke formation and ran off to attack some random counter-protester on the sidelines, forcing <b>Tarrio</b> and
                other leaders to constantly <i>corral</i> everyone back into marching formation. See timestamps
                <a href="https://youtu.be/9HY3IVStIJc?t=2161"><b>36:01</b></a> (<i>“we had so many fucking people go off on their own ... 
                I spend most of my time in rallies fucking bringing people back”</i>), 
                <a href="https://youtu.be/9HY3IVStIJc?t=2095"><b>34:55</b></a> (<i>“we're trying to avoid ... cowboy shit where people are running off”</i>),
                <a href="https://youtu.be/9HY3IVStIJc?t=1984"><b>33:04</b></a> (<i>“what I saw on Saturday was like a fucking pool of fucking unchained pit bulls just running into every situation”</i>),
                and <a href="https://youtu.be/9HY3IVStIJc?t=2566"><b>42:46</b></a> (<i>“running off ... can really put the rest of us in jeopardy”</i>).
                <br><br>
                The <b>MOSD</b> leadership also believed that failing to maintain formation while marching presented a serious
                safety risk. One concern was that an undisciplined Proud Boy could run off and do something crazy or violent
                that jeopardizes the entire Proud Boy organization with legal consequences. See timestamp
                <a href="https://youtu.be/9HY3IVStIJc?t=438"><b>7:18</b></a> (<i>“it will bury the entire club if one huge incident happens and we're at fault”</i>).
                A second concern was that political enemies of the Proud Boys (primarily local <i>anti-fascist</i>
                groups based in D.C.) could potentially infiltrate the Proud Boys' ranks during a march and
                inflict harm. See timestamp
                <a href="https://youtu.be/9HY3IVStIJc?t=4026"><b>1:07:06</b></a> (<i>“we got to be aware, is Antifa going to try to fucking walk into our formation and knife us in the back when we're fucking walking?”</i>).
                <br><br>
                Thus, the <b>MOSD</b> chapter was created specifically to address these issues. The new chapter established
                a stricter command structure than other Proud Boy chapters, giving leadership more leeway to
                discipline or remove unruly members. See timestamp 
                <a href="https://youtu.be/9HY3IVStIJc?t=274"><b>4:34</b></a> (<i>“this specific chapter is going to have a code of conduct stricter than other chapters 
                when it comes to these national public events”</i>). Secondly, the <b>MOSD</b> established new rallying policies intended to
                make it easier for leadership to control large numbers of Proud Boys while keeping everyone in formation during marches. These
                new policies included a ban on getting drunk during rallies and a new organizational structure that split
                everyone into smaller ten man squads controlled by designated squad leaders. The <b>MOSD</b> leadership
                believed that smaller squads would make it easier to keep tabs on everyone and keep everyone 
                in formation during marches. See timestamps
                <a href="https://youtu.be/9HY3IVStIJc?t=274"><b>4:34</b></a> (<i>“the biggest one is no intoxication”</i>),
                <a href="https://youtu.be/9HY3IVStIJc?t=1028"><b>17:08</b></a> (<i>“we're gonna break you guys down into ten man squads”</i>),
                and <a href="https://youtu.be/9HY3IVStIJc?t=4831"><b>1:20:31</b></a> (<i>“it's easier to herd ten cats than a hundred ... it's easier to keep everyone together that way”</i>).
                <br><br>
                The idea was that during public marches, the <b>MOSD</b> Proud Boys would split up into ten man squads, 
                but all squads would remain close together in formation, forming a <b><i>single unit or “nucleus”</i></b>.
                See timestamps 
                <a href="https://youtu.be/9HY3IVStIJc?t=1093"><b>18:13</b></a> (<i>“even though we're staying together ... we're still going to split up into [ten man squads]”</i>)
                and <a href="https://youtu.be/9HY3IVStIJc?t=4831"><b>1:20:31</b></a> (<i>“[squads] are still going to be co-located ... we're not going to have one group of 10 guys 8 fucking blocks to the east”</i>),
                <br><br>
                Thus, the <b>MOSD Zoom meeting</b> clearly establishes the <i><b>true</b></i> purpose of the <b>MOSD</b> chapter, and it
                had <i>nothing</i> to do with some secret plan to storm the Capitol. It was simply a new chapter with
                different rules designed to address many of the problems that cropped up during the earlier rally on December 12th, 2020.
                <br><br>
                <hr>
                <br>                
                During the conspiracy trial, the prosecution claimed that the <b>MOSD</b> chapter was created primarily to
                make a plan to storm the Capitol on January 6th, 2021. Apart from all the evidence outlined above clearly refuting the
                prosecution's claim, the <b>MOSD Zoom meeting</b> also proves that the scope of the <b>MOSD</b> chapter extended <i>well beyond</i> January
                6th, 2021. The new chapter applied to any
                future rallies in Washington DC and was intended to grow slowly for <i>years</i> to come.

                Indeed, during the <b>MOSD Zoom meeting</b>, <b>Enrique Tarrio</b> was <i>already</i>

                        um, and then that'll be the team for the 6th. <b>And then from the 6th through the 20th, if we decide

                Therefore, the <b>MOSD</b> chapter was not created <i>specifically</i> for the January 6th rally. It was
                created as a new national-level chapter applicable to <i>all</i> future rallies held in Washington DC.
                However, the January 6th rally still had some special significance for the <b>MOSD</b> Proud Boys,
                because it was the first rally the new <b>MOSD</b> chapter would attend. 
                <br><br>
                But what did <b>Enrique Tarrio</b>
                and the <b>MOSD</b> Proud Boys actually plan <i><b>to do</b></i> in DC on January 6th, 2021? The prosecution would
                of course claim (without any substantial evidence) that the <b>MOSD</b> Proud Boys planned to storm the Capitol on January 6th. 
                This is almost certainly not true, however some <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20220626172210/https://www.nytimes.com/2022/06/26/us/politics/proud-boys-jan-6.html">

                Certainly, <b>Tarrio's</b> response here may be interpreted as cagey or suspicious. Instead of
                elaborating on the <i>“operational goal”</i> of the January 6th rally, <b>Enrique Tarrio</b> 
                avoided the question, promising to discuss details about January 6th later during a follow-up video conference. Whether
                this follow-up video conference ever actually happened is unknown, and law enforcement never
                recovered any such video.
                <br><br>
                However, the reality is that <b>Enrique Tarrio</b> <i>DID</i> in fact explain the 
                <i>“operational goal”</i> of the January 6th rally — on <i>multiple</i> occasions no less — yet
                nobody else covering the Proud Boy trial seems to have noticed. This is somewhat understandable,
                because the verbiage <b>Tarrio</b> used to explain his plan for January 6th was a bit obscure. 
                Nevertheless, <b>Enrique Tarrio</b> did (more or less clearly) explain the operational goal or plan
                for the January 6th rally, both on Telegram <i>and</i> in the <b>MOSD Zoom meeting</b>.
                <br><br>
                Essentially, <b>Enrique Tarrio</b> wanted to use the Jan 6 rally as an opportunity to <b><i>field test</i></b> the new <b>MOSD</b> 
                command structure and rallying policies. In the 
                <a href="https://sigsegv1980.github.io/j6/ProudBoys-MOSD-MAIN-FullChatMessages-2020-12-27_2021-1-1.pdf#page=194"><b>MOSD MAIN Telegram group chat</b></a>, Tarrio
                stated <b><i>“we are going to be using the 6th as a test”</i></b> and explained that the <b>MOSD</b> chapter would be
                running <i><b>“training exercises”</b></i> during <a href="https://sigsegv1980.github.io/j6/ProudBoys-MOSD-MAIN-FullChatMessages-2020-12-27_2021-1-1.pdf#page=118">
                <i>“the 5th at night and 6th throughout the day”</i></a>.
                This is consistent with <b>Tarrio's</b> statements
                during the <b>MOSD Zoom meeting</b> (timestamp <a href="https://youtu.be/9HY3IVStIJc?t=1051"><b>17:31</b></a>)
                elaborating on the new policy of splitting up into smaller 10-man squads and summarizing the actual
                plan for January 6th: <i>“<b>As of right now, the plans for the sixth is just to remain as a nucleus</b>”</i>. 
                Essentially, <b>Tarrio</b> wanted to use the Jan 6 rally as an opportunity to <b>test drive the new MOSD</b> chapter by trying to navigate the 
                streets of DC as a cohesive, disciplined, well-oiled infantry, subdivided into 10 man squads orbiting a single <i>“<b>nucleus</b>”</i>:

                    </div>
                </div>
                When we synthesize <b>Enrique Tarrio's</b> statements about “<b><i>remaining as a nucleus</i></b>” and 
                staying <b><i>“as one fucking unit”</i></b> with his other statements describing the agenda for January 6th
                <i>“<a href="https://sigsegv1980.github.io/j6/ProudBoys-MOSD-MAIN-FullChatMessages-2020-12-27_2021-1-1.pdf#page=194"><b>as a test</b></a>”</i>
                involving <i>“<a href="https://sigsegv1980.github.io/j6/ProudBoys-MOSD-MAIN-FullChatMessages-2020-12-27_2021-1-1.pdf#page=118"><b>training exercises</b></a>”</i>,
                Tarrio's <i><b>TRUE</b></i>
                plan for January 6th becomes pretty clear. Again, <b>Tarrio</b> basically wanted to use the January 6 rally 
                to <b><i>field test</i></b> a march with the <b>MOSD</b> Proud Boys through the streets of DC. The <i>“operational goal”</i> was to
                divide the attending <b>MOSD</b> Proud Boys into ten-man squads while maintaining 
                a single overall marching formation (<b><i>“stay as one fucking unit”</i></b> and <b><i>“remain as a nucleus”</i></b>)
                throughout the march. The stricter
                <b>MOSD</b> command structure and rallying policies (e.g. <a href="https://youtu.be/9HY3IVStIJc?t=273">banning intoxication</a>) were intended to help leadership
                coordinate the ten-man squads while maintaining a single overall formation like a well-disciplined, professional infantry.
                <br><br>
                Thus, <b>Enrique Tarrio</b> did, in fact, explain the plan or <i>“operational goal”</i> for the Jan 6 rally, and it had absolutely
                nothing to do with storming any Capitols.

                In this Telegram discussion, as the <b>MOSD</b> Proud Boys made preparations for

                During the conspiracy trial, the prosecution claimed that many of the preparations made by the Proud Boys
                in advance of January 6th, including their decision to dress “incognito” instead of donning the traditional
                black and yellow Proud Boy theme colors, was all part of their secret plan to attack the police and storm
                the Capitol building. However, a large body of Telegram evidence demonstrates that the Proud Boys'
                decision to dress “incognito” had absolutely nothing to do with any secret plan to storm the Capitol.
                Rather, the “incognito” dress-code policy was primarily intended to conceal their identity (and
                <a href="https://youtu.be/9HY3IVStIJc?t=578">their numbers</a>) from <b>Antifa</b>,
                so the Proud Boys could potentially infiltrate or <a href="https://sigsegv1980.github.io/j6/ProudBoys-MOSD-Main-2020-12-27_2021-1-4.pdf#page=7">
                ambush them</a>, or at least avoid unwanted attention from anti-fascist
                counter-protesters. This is made pretty clear from <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20201230013057/https://parler.com/post/d6927a18b0634b78b330ca998f670692">
                Parler posts by <b>Joseph Biggs</b></a> and <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20210110193046/https://parler.com/profile/vigocarpathian">other Proud Boys</a>. 
                But the 
                Telegram discussion quoted in the left column proves this fairly <b><i>definitively</i></b>. Here,
                <b>Joseph Biggs</b>, an upper-tier <b>MOSD</b> leader and the right-hand man of <b>Enrique Tarrio</b>, makes
                it absolutely clear that the purpose of dressing “incognito” was primarily to conceal their identities from
                <b>Antifa</b>. <b>Biggs</b> says <i>“we will need to cover our beards”</i> in order to <i>“blend in”</i> because 
                <i>“we all have beards for the most part and antifa don't”</i>. 
                <br><br>
                In a later post in the same <a href="https://sigsegv1980.github.io/j6/ProudBoys-ExportedTelegramChatMOSDOp/messages.html#go_to_message432">
                <b>MOSD Ops</b> Telegram group chat</a> (made only <i>3 days</i> before January 6th), <b>Enrique Tarrio</b> himself reiterates the
                same point <b>Joseph Biggs</b> made about hiding their beards, saying:

                Again, this proves fairly <b><i>definitively</i></b> that the primary purpose of dressing “incognito” was to
                conceal their identities from <b>Antifa</b>, <i>not</i> to attack the cops and storm the Capitol. (Ultimately all of
                this turned out to be moot, because many high-ranking <b>MOSD</b> Proud Boys didn't bother to conceal their identity
                on January 6th anyway, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oSOsG5kN5wc">marching around with their faces entirely exposed</a>.)

                <hr>
                <br>
                Finally, we know from the <a href="https://youtu.be/9HY3IVStIJc?t=578"><b>MOSD Zoom call</b> at timestamp <b>9:36</b></a>

                that the “incognito” dress-code was a strategic deception intended to make the Proud Boys <i>“appear bigger than what we are”</i>.
                It is also almost certain that this strategy was devised with <b>Antifa</b> in mind (<i>not</i> the cops) because
                <b>Enrique Tarrio</b> explicitly told the DC police, in advance of January 6th, through his

                that the Proud Boys would not be wearing colors and would attend in small numbers on January 6:

                Thus, it's pretty clear
                that <b>Tarrio</b> didn't care if the DC police knew that the Proud Boys would be relatively “under-staffed” on January 6th. We know
                <b>Tarrio</b> wasn't lying to the police here, because 
                <a href="https://youtu.be/9HY3IVStIJc?t=578">he said the <i>same</i> thing privately</a> during the <b>MOSD Zoom Meeting</b>. All of this is yet further evidence
                that the "no colors" policy was primarily intended to avoid detection from <b>Antifa</b>, and had absolutely nothing to do
                with some secret plan to storm the Capitol.

                In this Telegram discussion (which took place 4 days before January 6th) in the <a href="https://sigsegv1980.github.io/j6/ProudBoys-MOSDChat-2020-12-20_2021-1-4.pdf#page=31">
                <b>MOSD leadership private group chat</b></a>, <b>MOSD</b> leader <b>Charles Donohoe</b> (<b>YutYut Cowabunga</b>)
                posted a recent <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20210102160355/https://twitter.com/HunterJCullen/status/1345399444896964615">
                tweet from <b>@HunterJCullen</b></a> that predicted major terroristic violence from right-wing groups (including
                the Proud Boys) in D.C. on January 6th. In particular, the tweet predicted that the Proud Boys and other right-wing groups would <i>“break into federal buildings”</i>
                and <i>“cause violence against law enforcement”</i>.
                <br><br>
                This Telegram discussion occurred on January 2nd, 2021, merely <i>4 days</i> before January 6th. Recall that during the
                conspiracy trial, the prosecution argued that the Proud Boys established the new “<b>Ministry Of Self Defense</b>” (<b>MOSD</b>)
                chapter primarily to secretly plan to attack the Capitol building on January 6th. <b>Enrique Tarrio</b> established the
                <b>MOSD</b> chapter as early as <b>December 20th, 2020</b>, when the <a href="https://sigsegv1980.github.io/j6/ProudBoys-MOSDChat-2020-12-20_2021-1-4.pdf">
                <b>MOSD</b> leadership Telegram group chat</a> (Govt Exhibit <b>501-1</b>) was first created. Therefore, by January 2nd, 2021,
                a mere <i>4 days</i> before January 6th, the plan to storm the Capitol should have been well underway, according to
                the prosecution. Intuitively, the Proud Boys' private reaction to a tweet <i>predicting</i> that they were planning a violent
                attack on January 6th
                that involved <i>“break[ing] into federal buildings”</i> should be somewhat telling.
                Presumably, this tweet should have been cause for at least <i>some</i> concern among the <b>MOSD</b> leadership, if they were actually
                secretly planning an attack that was similar to what this tweet predicted.
                <br><br>
                But the <b>MOSD</b> Proud Boys reacted with sarcasm and mildly amused bewilderment. <b>Charles Donohoe</b> responded with <i>“well fuck I guess I'm going now”</i>,
                and <b>Enrique Tarrio</b> joked <i>“Fuck, you guys get carried away sometimes. All I said was to wear black”</i>. 
                <b>Charles Donohoe</b> responded to <b>Tarrio</b>'s joke by recording a voice message of himself laughing.
                <br><br>
                About 10 minutes later, <b>Enrique Tarrio</b> posted another voice message, sharing his thoughts about the tweet. <b>Tarrio</b>'s 
                message can be paraphrased
                as a sarcastic “I <i>wish</i>!”. Specifically, he said <i>“<b>I wish we were half as cool</b> where we could coordinate something like 
                [the violent attacks described in the tweet]. If we wanted to”</i>. <b>Tarrio</b> then added some self-deprecating humor,
                saying <i>“but the truth is <b>we can’t even get guys to march in the same direction</b>”</i>. Of course, <b>Tarrio</b>'s
                joke about the Proud Boys' ineptitude was rooted in his genuine frustration over their <a href="https://youtu.be/9HY3IVStIJc?t=2161">pathetic inability to maintain 
                formation while marching</a>.
                <br><br>
                Then <b>John Charles Stewart</b> (<b>Johnny Blackbeard</b>), another high-ranking <b>MOSD</b> leader, chimed in with
                another self-deprecating voice message that added to <b>Tarrio's</b> response, saying <i>“Right? Imagine if anybody actually knew how fucking 
                retarded our members are”</i>.
                <br><br>
                The tone and content of these reactions strongly suggests that the Proud Boys had no plans <i>whatsoever</i> to storm the Capitol building any time soon,
                and that even the <i><b>very idea</b></i> that they would even be <i>capable</i> of pulling off such a thing registered
                as amusing to them. Furthermore, this conversation occurred only <i><b>4 days</b></i> before January 6th in a <i>private</i>
                Telegram group chat for upper-tier <b>MOSD</b> leadership, and it involved <b>Enrique Tarrio</b> himself — the
                alleged ringleader of the conspiracy to storm the Capitol.
                <br><br>
                This evidence is so strongly exculpatory that the only possible way for the prosecution to neutralize it would be to
                argue that the Proud Boys were purposely trying to mislead some hypothetical future FBI digital forensic examiner 
                reading these private Telegram chats. But of course, there is absolutely <i>zero</i> evidence this is the case. The Proud Boys
                only began to seriously worry about the possibility of law enforcement reading their private chats <i>after</i> 
                <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20220712213106/https://twitter.com/maustermuhle/status/1346521554855874565"><b>Enrique Tarrio</b> got arrested</a> 
                on January 4th, 2021 for an unrelated crime.
                Indeed, the Proud Boys regularly posted <i>highly incriminating</i> messages in these Telegram group chats, like plans to
                <a href="https://sigsegv1980.github.io/j6/ProudBoys-ExportedTelegramChatMOSDOp/messages.html#go_to_message533">illegally bring a concealed knife</a>
                to Washington DC, and <b>MOSD</b> leader <b>Jeremy Bertino</b> posted <i>“<a href="https://sigsegv1980.github.io/j6/ProudBoys-BootsOnTheGroundChat.pdf#page=10">Storming the capital 
                building right now!!</a>”</i> on the day of January 6th itself as the Capitol riot was in progress. Indeed,
                the prosecution's <i>entire <b>seditious conspiracy</b></i> case was based primarily on incriminating Telegram chats like that.
                <br><br>
                Therefore, there are no grounds for interpreting the Proud Boys' responses to the tweet here as anything but <i>authentic</i> reactions, and
                their reactions here <b><i>strongly</i></b> undermine the prosecution's conspiracy case. Thus, while the prediction in this tweet
                ultimately turned about to be partially correct, it was only correct <i>ironically</i>. Some Proud Boys
                did indeed <i>“break into federal buildings”</i> on January 6th, but they did so as participants in a spontaneous riot 
                rather than some sophisticated plan devised in advance.

                in the <a href="https://sigsegv1980.github.io/j6/2022-06-06-USAvEthanNordeanAndJosephBiggsAndZacharyRehlAndEnriqueTarrioAndDominicPezzola-ThirdSupersedingIndictment.pdf">
                <b>indictment</b></a> for their <b><i>seditious conspiracy</i></b> case, but omitted the surrounding context.
                <br><br>
                A superficial reading of these posts (particularly the
                post from <b>Johnny Blackbeard</b> talking about an <i>“operations base”</i> by the Capitol) may suggest these posts were part of 
                some larger conversation wherein the Proud Boys were discussing a plan to storm the Capitol. However, if you read the surrounding context, 
                and you have some background knowledge about what the Proud Boys typically did at rallies, then these Telegram posts become <b><i>exculpatory</i></b> 
                evidence. 
                <br><br>
                In reality, this conversation had nothing to do with some secret plan to storm the Capitol. The Proud Boys were actually 
                talking about <i><b>event planning</b></i>. Various organizations affiliated with the “<b>Stop The Steal</b>” movement had obtained
                <a href="https://sigsegv1980.github.io/j6/USCapitolPolicePermitsForEventsNearCapitol.pdf"><b>event permits</b></a>
                to hold rallies around event stages near the Capitol building on January 6th. 
                Apart from President Trump's speech (which was held at the Ellipse for security reasons), most of the 
                <a href="https://sigsegv1980.github.io/j6/Jan6MAGARallyMapGuideFull.pdf"><b>official events</b></a> scheduled 
                for the day of January 6th, 2021, were arranged to be held near the Capitol building. 
                For example, “<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20201223181220/https://latinosfortrump.us/"><b>Latinos For Trump</b></a>” had an 
                <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20210120221044/https://latinosfortrump.us/freedom-rally-jan-6">official event</a>
                located at <a href="https://sigsegv1980.github.io/j6/LatinosForTrumpJan6Flyer.pdf">“Area 7” on the Capitol grounds</a>
                from 10AM to 12PM on January 6th, 2021. 
                <br><br>
                Thus, <b>Johnny Blackbeard</b> suggested creating an <i>“operations base”</i> near the <i>“front entrance to the Capitol building”</i> 
                simply because he was aware that most of the <a href="https://sigsegv1980.github.io/j6/LatinosForTrumpJan6Flyer.pdf"><b>official events</b></a> 
                were to take place near the Capitol.
                <b>Johnny Blackbeard</b>'s
                statement about the Capitol building was in response to <b>Enrique Tarrio's</b> earlier post, where he said <i>"I'm getting so many 
                conflicting issues with, like, stages, locations, and times that, um, that I don't know where to put people."</i>       
                <b>Enrique Tarrio</b> was concerned about <i>"stages locations, and times"</i>
                because the Proud Boys planned to attend some of the <a href="https://sigsegv1980.github.io/j6/Jan6MAGARallyMapGuideFull.pdf"><b>official events on Jan 6</b></a> 
                and some Proud Boys were working security for these events.
                <br><br>
                The Proud Boys typically worked

                Indeed, it's very likely that <b>Enrique Tarrio</b> — who was

                Florida State director</a> of <b>Latinos for Trump</b> — was himself booked as a guest speaker at the

                on January 6th at “Area 7” (300 First Street NE) by the Capitol between 10 AM and 12 PM.
                (See trial testimony of 
                <a href="https://sigsegv1980.github.io/j6/2023-03-24-USAvProudBoys-TranscriptOfJuryTrial-Day54.pdf#page=63"><b>George Mesa</b></a> and

                This is why <b>Zach Rehl</b> asked <i>"<b>Is [Enrique Tarrio] still doing a speech?</b> Where is that?"</i>
                (<b>Tarrio</b> was ultimately 
                <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20210105023846/https://parler.com/post/99d45bcf635e4e319a4d20774f12831c">unable to give the speech</a> because he was

                <br><br>
                Finally, <b>Enrique Tarrio</b> was likely confused about the <i>"stages locations, and times"</i> of the 
                <a href="https://sigsegv1980.github.io/j6/Jan6MAGARallyMapGuideFull.pdf"><b>official events</b></a> for the
                same reasons that confused some of the event organizers themselves: firstly, there was a confusing 
                <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20210130155615/https://www.propublica.org/article/trump-campaign-fundraiser-ellipse-rally">power struggle
                between different event organizers</a> (see the depositions of

                and secondly, many of the official events and guest speakers were 
                <a href="https://sigsegv1980.github.io/j6/Jan6Committee-DepositionOfAmyKremer.pdf#page=83">cancelled or moved</a> to different locations

                In this Telegram discussion, as the <b>MOSD</b> Proud Boys made preparations for
                the upcoming Jan 6 rally, they discussed wearing protective equipment or body armor 
                to conceals their identity, in accordance with the new <b>MOSD</b> policy 
                <a href="https://youtu.be/9HY3IVStIJc?t=3668">prohibiting
                them from wearing traditional Proud Boy theme colors</a>. 
                During the conspiracy trial, the prosecution claimed that many of the preparations made by the Proud Boys
                in advance of January 6th, including their decision to dress “incognito” instead of wearing traditional
                black and yellow Proud Boy theme colors, was all part of a secret plan to attack the police and storm
                the Capitol building. However, a large body of Telegram evidence demonstrates that the Proud Boys'
                decision to dress “incognito” had absolutely nothing to do with any secret plan to storm the Capitol.
                Rather, the “incognito” dress-code policy was primarily intended to conceal their identity (and
                <a href="https://youtu.be/9HY3IVStIJc?t=578">their numbers</a>) from <b>Antifa</b>,
                so the Proud Boys could potentially infiltrate or <a href="https://sigsegv1980.github.io/j6/ProudBoys-MOSD-Main-2020-12-27_2021-1-4.pdf#page=7">
                ambush them</a>, or at least avoid unwanted attention from anti-fascist
                counter-protesters. This is made pretty clear from <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20201230013057/https://parler.com/post/d6927a18b0634b78b330ca998f670692">

                <br><br>
                But the post from <b>Enrique Tarrio</b> quoted in the left column proves fairly <b><i>definitively</i></b>
                that the purpose of dressing “incognito” was related to concerns about <b>Antifa</b> rather than the cops.

                In this Telegram discussion (which occurred 3 days before January 6), <b>MOSD</b> leader <b>Charles Donohoe</b> (<b>YutYut Cowabunga</b>) reposted 
                an <a href="https://sigsegv1980.github.io/j6/ProudBoys-ExportedTelegramChatMOSDOp/messages.html#go_to_message53">earlier
                message from <b>Enrique Tarrio</b></a>, reminding everyone about
                the <b>MOSD</b> chapter policy prohibiting
                the Proud Boys from <a href="https://youtu.be/9HY3IVStIJc?t=3668">wearing traditional black and yellow theme colors</a> to the rally on January 6th, 2021.
                As <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20201229170859/https://parler.com/post/c741b78505a54150bdf63d079952e8f0"><b>Enrique Tarrio</b> announced publicly on Parler</a>, 
                the Proud Boys would be attending the Jan 6 rally “incognito” and dressed in <i>“all BLACK”</i>, 
                similar to the way <i>anti-fascist</i> collectives (i.e. <b>Antifa</b>) typically dress. The term 
                “<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20100703130413/http://www.infoshop.org/amp/bgp/BlackBlockPapers2.pdf"><b>Black Bloc</b></a>”
                refers to an assembly of anonymous individuals who believe in an anarchist or <i>anti-fascist</i> ideology,
                and dress in identity-concealing black clothing while operating <i>in unison</i> at political protests or demonstrations, 
                usually with the goal of 
                <i>“<a href="BlackBlockPapers2.pdf#page=27">push[ing] protest actions in more militant directions</a>”</i>. However,
                informally the term “<b>Black Bloc</b>” can also refer simply to the all-black identity-concealing clothes 
                typically worn by members of a Black Bloc collective. This is how the term is used here by the Proud Boys.
                <br><br>
                In this Telegram conversation, a <b>MOSD</b> Proud Boy using the Telegram handle “<b>Saint Xhristopher</b>” asked the <b>MOSD</b> leadership whether 
                dressing in <i>“black bloc gear”</i> entailed wearing robust protective equipment like helmets and goggles, or 
                whether it was acceptable to wear <i>“just [black] clothes”</i>. <b>Charles Donohoe</b> answered this question, saying:
                <i>“[Just] clothes. There is a potential for a <b>simple and quick mission</b>. That is all.”</i>
                <br><br>
                During the conspiracy trial, the prosecution claimed that the “<b>Ministry Of Self Defense</b>” (<b>MOSD</b>) chapter of the Proud Boys
                was created for the primary purpose of planning in secret to storm the Capitol building on January 6th. Moreover, the 
                <a href="https://sigsegv1980.github.io/j6/2022-06-06-USAvEthanNordeanAndJosephBiggsAndZacharyRehlAndEnriqueTarrioAndDominicPezzola-ThirdSupersedingIndictment.pdf">
                prosecution also claimed</a> that many of the preparations the Proud Boys made in advance of January 6th, like bringing body armor and protective gear
                with them to Washington D.C., were all part of their secret plan to attack the police and storm the Capitol building.
                <br><br>
                However, the Telegram discussion quoted here in the left column significantly undermines the prosecution's case. 
                Firstly, while many <b>MOSD</b> Proud Boys did indeed decide to wear body armor or protective equipment on January 6th,
                this Telegram discussion reveals that the <b>MOSD</b> leadership didn't actually <i>order</i> the “rank and file” to wear 
                this sort of equipment. Rather, 
                <b>Charles Donohoe</b>, an upper-tier <b>MOSD</b> leader, told a “rank and file” Proud Boy to just wear regular
                (black) clothes. 
                <br><br>
                Secondly, <b>Charles Donohoe</b> — again, an upper-tier <b>MOSD</b> leader — described the agenda for January 6th as 
                a <i>“<b>simple and quick mission</b>”</i>. This hardly sounds like the <b>MOSD</b> Proud Boys were expecting
                to storm the Capitol and clash with the police on January 6th. 
                <br><br>
                However, <i>“<b>a simple and quick mission</b>”</i> 
                <i>does</i> nicely jibe with
                <b>Enrique Tarrio's</b> description of the plan for January 6th 
                as <i>“<a href="https://sigsegv1980.github.io/j6/ProudBoys-MOSD-MAIN-FullChatMessages-2020-12-27_2021-1-1.pdf#page=194"><b>a test</b></a>”</i> or a
                <i>“<a href="https://sigsegv1980.github.io/j6/ProudBoys-MOSD-MAIN-FullChatMessages-2020-12-27_2021-1-1.pdf#page=118"><b>training exercise</b></a>”</i> 
                with the straightforward objective of marching <i>“<a href="https://youtu.be/9HY3IVStIJc?t=1460"><b>as one fucking unit</b></a>”</i>.
                Indeed, the Proud Boys' <i><b>real</b></i> plan for January 6 was actually quite mundane. <b>Enrique Tarrio</b> essentially wanted
                to <b><i>field test</i></b> the new <b>MOSD</b> chapter — to take it for a spin in the streets of D.C. and test out the new rallying policies
                and command structure to see if they worked as anticipated.

                In this Telegram conversation (which occurred only 2 days before January 6th) the <b>MOSD</b> Proud Boys
                were sharing ideas about the sort of <b>weapons</b> they should bring to Washington D.C. for the Jan 6 rally
                and discussing strategies for defending themselves from attacks.
                They mentioned high-powered LED flashlights or laser emitters
                meant to temporarily blind an opponent as well as pepper spray. The discussion quoted here
                exemplifies the sort of topics typically discussed in the <a href="https://sigsegv1980.github.io/j6/ProudBoys-ExportedTelegramChatMOSDOp/messages.html"><b>MOSD Ops</b></a>
                Telegram group chat throughout the week leading up to January 6th, 2021.
                <br><br>
                During the conspiracy trial, the prosecution claimed that the Proud Boys brought weapons and
                wore body armor on January 6th specifically because they had planned to attack the police
                and storm the Capitol building. However, a large body of Telegram evidence, including
                conversations like the one quoted here in the left column, proves fairly definitively
                that the Proud Boys did <i>not</i> anticipate a battle with the police, but rather
                anticipated a battle with local anti-fascist counter-protesters (i.e. <b>Antifa</b>), their long-time street rivals.
                Nonetheless, the prosecution explicitly denied this to be true, saying:
                <br><br>
                <div class="blurb">
                    <a href="https://sigsegv1980.github.io/j6/2023-08-17-USAvEthanNordeanAndJosephBiggsAndZacharyRehlAndEnriqueTarrioAndDominicPezzola-GovernmentSentencingMemorandum.pdf">Sentencing memorandum reads</a>:
                    <div class="inner-blurb">
                        As laid bare by the defendants’ own words before and on January 6, the defendants’
                        preparation for conflict was not focused on Antifa — it was the preparation for conflict with law
                        enforcement and government officials who they had declared traitors.
                    </div>
                </div>
                To say that the <b>MOSD</b> Proud Boys were <i>“not focused on Antifa”</i> is an <b><i>absurd</i></b> claim that flies in the face of the
                large corpus of Telegram evidence wherein the <b>MOSD</b> Proud Boys <i>clearly</i> indicate they
                expect to fight <b>Antifa</b> in the streets of D.C. on January 6th at night. For example, the discussion 
                quoted here in the left column makes it patently obvious
                that the Proud Boys were <i>not</i> talking about fighting the cops. 
                <b>MOSD</b> Proud Boy “<b>Richard WD Stomper</b>”
                described some of his opponents' typical attack patterns,
                saying <i>“they strobe you to blind [and] then attack [you]”</i>, 
                and <i>“you become disoriented as <b>they hit you with bats and shit</b>”</i>. Here, <b>Richard WD Stomper</b>
                was quite <i>clearly</i> NOT referring to the police. In general, police typically use firearms or 
                <a href="https://mpdc.dc.gov/sites/default/files/dc/sites/mpdc/publication/attachments/5.1%20Use%20of%20Force%20Overview%20FINAL.pdf#page=5">riot control weapons</a> 
                like OC spray,
                rubber bullets, batons and tasers. They don't typically <i>“hit you with bats and shit”</i> or 
                <i>“strobe you to blind [you] then attack [you]”</i>. It is absolutely clear that <b>Richard WD Stomper</b>
                was talking about fighting <b>Antifa</b>, <i>not</i> the police.

                released by the <b>Department of Homeland Security</b></a> in June of 2020
                mentions both <b>laser pointers</b> and <b>bats</b> as weapons used by “<i>anarchist extremists</i>” (a DHS/FBI
                term for <b>Antifa</b>) at protest events. Similarly, a 
                <a href="https://sigsegv1980.github.io/j6/2020-12-28-UnitedStatesParkPoliceExecutiveBrief-6January2021-WMADemonstrationsActivity.pdf"><b>US Park Police</b></a>
                briefing released in late December of 2020
                predicted there would be <i>“street-level confrontation/violence”</i> on January 6th between the Proud Boys
                and <i>“far-left groups”</i> (presumably local <b>Antifa</b> collectives) with weapons such as laser pointers.

                Additionally, the Proud Boys had good reasons to expect

                This Telegram post (from only 2 days before January 6th) is part of an ongoing conversation wherein the <b>MOSD</b> Proud Boys
                shared ideas about <b>weapons</b> and discussed strategies for defending themselves.
                The post quoted here exemplifies the sort of topics typically discussed in the

                January 6th specifically because they had planned to attack the police and storm the Capitol building. However, a 
                large body of Telegram evidence proves fairly 
                definitively that the Proud Boys did not anticipate a battle with the police on January 6th, but rather anticipated a battle 
                with local <i>anti-fascist</i> counter-protesters (i.e. <b>Antifa</b>), their long-time street rivals.
                <br><br>
                For example, in the post quoted here in the left column, <b>MOSD</b> Proud Boy “<b>Richard WD Stomper</b>”
                suggests some battle strategies for the upcoming Jan 6 rally. He frames this anticipated battle as something 
                he expected would likely happen on Jan 6
                if the Proud Boys were to <i>“go lurking after the sun goes down”</i>. But if the Proud Boys
                truly had a secret plan to storm the Capitol building and clash with the police on January 6th, the Proud Boys would
                surely expect to be tied up indefinitely in some kind of intense, open-ended siege or occupation of the Capitol building
                with an uncertain outcome. If this was <i>truly</i> their expectation, <b>Richard WD Stomper</b>'s comment
                about <i>“lurking after the sun goes down”</i> makes very little sense. But it makes <i>perfect</i> sense
                if he was expecting a typical rally experience entailing a

                In this Telegram conversation (which occurred only 2 days before January 6th) the <b>MOSD</b> Proud Boys were sharing 
                ideas about the sort of weapons they should bring to Washington D.C. for the Jan 6 rally. 
                Earlier in the conversation, they mentioned <a href="https://sigsegv1980.github.io/j6/ProudBoys-ExportedTelegramChatMOSDOp/messages.html#go_to_message522">
                laser emitters</a> and

                blind an opponent. In the conversation snippet quoted here, a Proud Boy using the Telegram handle “<b>Gabriel PB</b>” announced his
                intention to bring a knife, prompting another Proud Boy to ask about the legality of carrying a pocket knife in DC. <b>Enrique Tarrio</b> 
                chimed in, warning of <i>“heavy restrictions”</i>. 
                This discussion exemplifies the sort of topics typically 
                discussed in the <a href="https://sigsegv1980.github.io/j6/ProudBoys-ExportedTelegramChatMOSDOp/messages.html"><b>MOSD Ops</b></a>
                Telegram group chat throughout the week leading up to January 6th, 2021.
                <br><br>
                During the conspiracy trial, the prosecution claimed that the Proud Boys had planned in advance to storm the Capitol
                and brought weapons and body armor with them in preparation for a violent conflict with the police defending the Capitol building.
                However, a large body of Telegram evidence, including conversations 
                like the one quoted here in the left column, proves fairly conclusively that the Proud Boys did not anticipate a battle with the police, 
                but rather expected to do battle with local <i>anti-fascist</i> counter-protesters (i.e. <b>Antifa</b>), their 
                <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20201212160329/https://www.capradio.org/articles/2020/12/05/antifa-protesters-confront-pro-trump-demonstrators-proud-boys-at-californias-capitol-violence-ensues/">long-time 
                street rivals at protests and rallies</a>. 
                But the prosecution explicitly denied this to be true, saying:
                <br><br>
                <div class="blurb">
                    <a href="https://sigsegv1980.github.io/j6/2023-08-17-USAvEthanNordeanAndJosephBiggsAndZacharyRehlAndEnriqueTarrioAndDominicPezzola-GovernmentSentencingMemorandum.pdf">Sentencing memorandum reads</a>:
                    <div class="inner-blurb">
                        As laid bare by the defendants’ own words before and on January 6, the defendants’
                        preparation for conflict was not focused on Antifa — it was the preparation for conflict with law
                        enforcement and government officials who they had declared traitors.
                    </div>
                </div>
                Saying that the <b>MOSD</b> Proud Boys were <i>“not focused on Antifa”</i> is an <b><i>absurd</i></b> claim that contradicts
                a mountain of Telegram evidence <i>clearly</i> demonstrating that the <b>MOSD</b> Proud Boys
                expected to battle <b>Antifa</b> (<i>not</i> the cops) on January 6th, and therefore brought weapons 
                and body armor to DC in preparation for this anticipated conflict with <b>Antifa</b>. For example,
                in the Telegram conversation quoted here in the left column, <b>Gabriel PB</b> explicitly
                names <b>Antifa</b> as the reason he is bringing his knife to DC, saying
                <i>“I am taking a knife 🔪 also <b>because fuck ANTIFA twice</b>”</i>. 
                <br><br>
                This is also consistent with earlier parts of this Telegram conversation wherein the Proud Boys
                described the opponent they expected to battle on January 6th as an opponent that uses
                strobe lights <i>“<a href="https://sigsegv1980.github.io/j6/ProudBoys-ExportedTelegramChatMOSDOp/messages.html#go_to_message485">to blind [and] then attack [you]</a>”</i> 
                so that <i>“<a href="https://sigsegv1980.github.io/j6/ProudBoys-ExportedTelegramChatMOSDOp/messages.html#go_to_message486">you become disoriented as 
                they hit you with bats and shit</a>”</i>. It's clear that the opponent described here
                is <i>NOT</i> the police. Police typically use firearms or 
                <a href="https://mpdc.dc.gov/sites/default/files/dc/sites/mpdc/publication/attachments/5.1%20Use%20of%20Force%20Overview%20FINAL.pdf#page=5">riot control weapons</a> 
                like OC spray,
                rubber bullets, batons and tasers, but they generally don't <i>“hit you with bats and shit”</i> or 
                blind you with strobe lights. But <b>Antifa</b> uses strobe lights or 
                <a href="https://sigsegv1980.github.io/j6/2020-07-13-USAvCarubis-2.pdf#page=8">laser emitters</a> as well as 
                <a href="https://sigsegv1980.github.io/j6/2020-08-18-USAvHorton.pdf#page=12">baseball bats</a> and 
                other <a href="https://sigsegv1980.github.io/j6/2020-07-12-USAvGaines-3.pdf#page=14">blunt force weapons</a>.
                Indeed, a <a href="https://sigsegv1980.github.io/2020-06-01-DHS-ViolentOpportunistTacticsObservedDuringCivilDisturbances.pdf"><b>DHS</b> intelligence briefing</a>
                from June of 2020 mentioned <b>laser pointers</b> and <b>baseball bats</b> 
                as weapons observed to be used by “<i>anarchist extremists</i>” (a DHS/FBI
                term for <b>Antifa</b>).
                <br><br>
                Thus, the Telegram evidence makes it abundantly clear that preparations for conflict made by the Proud Boys,
                such as bringing weapons and body armor to DC for the Jan 6 rally, were made in anticipation
                of violent street fights with <b>Antifa</b> (<i>not</i> the cops), long-time ideological rivals with whom

                This was also the expectation described in an intelligence brief from the <b>US Park Police</b> stating 
                <i>“we should expect [Jan 6 to be] an event similar to those that occurred on 14 November 2020

                followed by 
                a <i>“<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20201118012633/https://www.washingtonpost.com/dc-md-va/2020/11/14/million-maga-march-dc-protests/"><b>night-time part</b></a>”</i> 
                when the Proud Boys <a href="https://youtu.be/ZQawR_tbIC8?t=2497">roamed the streets of DC after dark</a> and
                <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20201213045338/https://www.nbcwashington.com/news/local/trump-supporters-maga-rally-protest-dc-saturday/2506267/">
                clashed violently with <b>Antifa</b> counter-protesters</a>.
                <br><br>
                But if the Proud Boys had <b><i>truly</i></b> devised a plan in secret to storm the Capitol, their expectations
                for January 6 would be fundamentally different. They would <i>not</i> expect a typical rally experience involving
                marches and protests during the day and street fights with <b>Antifa</b> at night. Rather, the Proud Boys would
                surely expect to be tied up indefinitely in an intense, open-ended siege or occupation of the Capitol building 
                that could go on for days or even weeks before some definitive outcome was reached.
                <br><br>
                Yet in the Telegram conversation quoted here in the left column, after learning that the <b>National Guard</b>
                would be deployed throughout the streets of DC, <b>MOSD</b> Proud Boy <b>Alekos</b> reacted by saying 
                <i>“it’s gonna get real interesting <b>at night time</b> can hardly fucking wait”</i>.
                But this response makes very little sense if <b>Alekos</b> expected to be storming the Capitol
                building on January 6th. Why would <b>Alekos</b> express excitement about the <b>National
                Guard</b> being deployed throughout the streets of DC or eagerly look forward to an interesting
                <i>“night time”</i> if he expected to participate in an
                intense, life-changing siege inside the Capitol building that might last well into the night and beyond?
                <br><br>
                However, if no secret plan to storm the Capitol ever actually existed, and the Proud Boys
                expected January 6th
                to play out similarly to earlier MAGA rallies, then <b>Alekos'</b> statement would make a lot more sense.
                With no secret conspiracy to attack the Capitol, <b>Alekos</b> would expect a typical rally
                experience involving daytime protests followed by night-time brawls with <b>Antifa</b> in the streets
                of DC. In this case, the only <i>new</i> and potentially <i>“interesting”</i> variable, from the perspective
                of the attending Proud Boys, would be the presence of <b>National Guard</b> soldiers and the
                uncertainty over how they might react to the Proud Boys. <b>MOSD</b> leader <b>Jeremy Bertino</b> chimed in to
                ponder the question <i>“does the military and the <b>National Guard</b> fuck up Trump supporters? 
                Or do they fuck up <b>Antifa</b>? I guess that's what we're going to have to see”</i>.
                <br><br>
                Thus, <b>Alekos'</b> eagerness to experience an interesting <i>“night time”</i> would make a lot more sense
                if there was never any secret plan to storm the Capitol. In that case, <b>Alekos</b> would have expected a typical
                rallying experience, brawling with <b>Antifa</b> in the streets after dark, but with
                deployed <b>National Guard</b> soldiers introducing
                a new element of uncertainty as to where their loyalties might lie.
                <br><br>
                Furthermore, there was a consistent fussing over <b>Antifa</b> throughout this whole conversation about 
                the <b>National Guard</b>, exemplified by <b>Jeremy Bertino's</b> question <i>“does the ... <b>National Guard</b> 
                fuck up Trump supporters? Or do they fuck up <b>Antifa</b>?”</i> The Proud Boys seemed to process the
                news about the <b>National Guard</b> exclusively in terms of how a military presence in DC might impact 
                the dynamic between the Proud Boys and <b>Antifa</b> out on the street. This is very hard to reconcile with
                a secret plan to storm the Capitol. If the Proud Boys <i>truly</i> were planning to attack the Capitol,
                why would they even <i>care</i> how the <b>National Guard</b> reacts to <b>Antifa</b>? The deployment of the
                <b>National Guard</b> in DC should have registered as a <i>serious threat</i> to the Proud Boys if they were really planning
                a major assault on the Capitol and the police officers defending it, while 
                <b>Antifa</b> should have been mostly irrelevant.
                <br><br>
                This consistent focus on <b>Antifa</b> is very telling and it <i>strongly</i> suggests that no secret conspiracy
                to storm the Capitol ever existed. With no secret conspiracy, the Proud Boys would have expected the Jan 6 rally 
                to play out similarly to earlier rallies, where <b>Antifa</b> counter-protesters were the primary threat. Indeed, this fussing over
                the question of how <i>trained <b>National Guard</b> soldiers</i> might react to <b>Antifa</b> street thugs 
                reveals that the Proud Boys never had any “bigger” plans — they were consistently focused on <b>Antifa</b>
                right up until the moment when hundreds of rioters began storming the Capitol in the early afternoon
                of January 6th. (This conclusion is also consistent with <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oSOsG5kN5wc"><b>Eddie Block's</b> Jan 6 livestream</a>,
                which reveals that <i>even on the morning of January 6th itself</i>, 
                the Proud Boys were <i><b>still</b></i> primarily
                focused on <b>Antifa</b> — marching around DC <a href="https://youtu.be/oSOsG5kN5wc?t=5590">looking for <b>Antifa</b></a> and chanting 
                <i>“<a href="https://youtu.be/oSOsG5kN5wc?t=5620"><b>Fuck Antifa!</b></a>”</i> — right up until 
                the moment when hundreds of rioters started attacking the Capitol.)

                In this Telegram discussion (from the day before January 6th), <b>MOSD</b> leader <b>Zach Rehl</b> still had

                During the conspiracy trial, the prosecution claimed that the
                <i>primary purpose</i> of the <b>MOSD</b> chapter was to secretly plan an attack on the Capitol, and that
                this secret conspiracy began as early as December 20th, 2020. Yet in the Telegram posts quoted here in the left column, dating to
                only <i>one day</i> before January 6th, <b>Zach Rehl</b> — an upper-tier <b>MOSD</b> leader — still had <i>basic</i>
                questions about the plan for Jan 6, like whether or not they still were going to <i>“break off on teams”</i>
                and what objectives were <i>“agreed on anyway”</i>. 
                <br><br>
                Some of this confusion could be attributable to the overall uncertainty resulting from <b>Enrique Tarrio's</b> 
                <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20220712213106/https://twitter.com/maustermuhle/status/1346521554855874565">arrest on January 4th</a> 
                for an unrelated crime, which — secret conspiracy or no secret conspiracy — certainly
                <a href="https://sigsegv1980.github.io/j6/ProudBoys-MOSD-MAIN2-2021-1-4_2021-1-5.pdf#page=8">disrupted the Proud Boys' original plans</a> to some 
                extent and caused some confusion. Yet the Telegram evidence suggests a more fundamental lack of advance-planning that extends well beyond
                the scrambling to compensate for <b>Enrique Tarrio</b>'s arrest.
                <br><br>
                Indeed, even on the <i>day before January 6th</i> there was no discussion on Telegram about any secret plan
                to attack the Capitol. Instead, many <b>MOSD</b> Proud Boys were 
                <a href="https://sigsegv1980.github.io/j6/ProudBoys-BootsOnTheGroundChat.pdf#page=3">asking <i>basic questions</i></a> about
                what everyone was even supposed to be doing on Jan 6. The only <i>specific details</i> of the plan ever mentioned at this time 
                were the instructions
                to meet at the <b>Washington Monument</b> (not even the Capitol building) at 10 AM. And <b>Zach Rehl</b> didn't even know if <i>“we still have plans to break 
                off on teams”</i>. The idea of splitting up into teams was 
                <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20201229170859/https://parler.com/post/c741b78505a54150bdf63d079952e8f0">proposed by <b>Enrique Tarrio</b></a> 
                back in mid-December of 2020, and became a major topic of discussion during the <a href="https://youtu.be/9HY3IVStIJc?t=1019"><b>MOSD Zoom Meeting</b></a>,
                where it was clearly established that the purpose of splitting into teams was to make it easier to 
                <a href="https://youtu.be/9HY3IVStIJc?t=2161">maintain
                formation and stay together</a> during public marches, in order to <a href="https://youtu.be/9HY3IVStIJc?t=438">avoid the sort of disaster</a> that happened
                during an earlier MAGA rally in December when four Proud Boys 
                <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20201213043848/https://www.the-sun.com/news/1959359/million-maga-march-dc-trump-steal-election-stabbing/">got stabbed</a>. 
                It had absolutely <i>nothing</i> to do with some secret
                plan to storm the Capitol.
                <br><br>
                Therefore, it's considerably <i>more likely</i> that no conspiracy to storm the Capitol ever existed, and that 
                the <i><b>real</b></i> plan
                for January 6th was, as the actual Telegram evidence <b><i>strongly</i></b> suggests, something much more mundane: a

                In this Telegram discussion (from the evening before January 6th) many <b>MOSD</b> Proud Boys
                were arriving in DC as leadership tried to get a headcount. A Proud Boy with the Telegram handle
                “<b>Kreeper 2nd* HVNY</b>” expressed his frustration over the perceived lack of any plan or direction, 
                complaining to the <b>MOSD</b> leadership that <i>“this is so unorganized!”</i> and that
                <i>“[there's] no fuckin plan either”</i>. <b>Joe Biggs</b>, representing the <b>MOSD</b> leadership,
                tried to assuage the “rank and file”, explaining that the plan isn't quite finalized because

                This is one of several Telegram conversations from January 5th and the morning of January 6th itself

                During the conspiracy trial, the prosecution claimed that the <i>primary</i> purpose of the <b>MOSD</b> chapter was to secretly plan an attack on the Capitol, 
                and that this secret conspiracy began as early as December 20th, 2020. Yet in the Telegram discussion quoted here in the left column 
                from the <i>evening before January 6th</i>, it's clear that the “rank and file” Proud Boys had no clue what the plan for Jan 6
                was, while leadership seemed to be coming up with a plan on the fly.
                <br><br>
                Some of this confusion and last-minute planning could be attributable to the uncertainty resulting from <b>Enrique Tarrio's</b> 
                <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20220712213106/https://twitter.com/maustermuhle/status/1346521554855874565">arrest on January 4th</a> 
                for an unrelated crime, which — secret conspiracy or no secret conspiracy — certainly
                <a href="https://sigsegv1980.github.io/j6/ProudBoys-MOSD-MAIN2-2021-1-4_2021-1-5.pdf#page=8">disrupted the Proud Boys' original plans</a> 
                to some extent and caused some confusion. Yet the Telegram evidence suggests a more fundamental lack of advance-planning that extends well beyond
                the scrambling to compensate for <b>Enrique Tarrio</b>'s arrest. As the Telegram posts quoted in the left column clearly demonstrate, on 
                the evening before January 6th, the “rank and file” still seemingly had <i>no idea</i> what they would be doing in DC at all. 
                <br><br>
                This isn't really the strongest piece of exculpatory evidence, because the prosecution could argue that the “rank and file”
                Proud Boys simply weren't “in the loop” at this time, and that the <b>MOSD</b> leadership would let them know the <b>real</b> plan
                on the morning of January 6. Of course, that would be pure speculation, and furthermore, some of the 
                <a href="https://sigsegv1980.github.io/j6/ProudBoys-NewMOSD-2021-1-4_2021-1-13.pdf#page=18"><b>MOSD</b> upper-tier
                <b>leaders</b> had no clue what the plan was either</a>.
                <br><br>
                The fact remains that even on 
                the <i>night before January 6th</i> there was still <b><i>zero discussion</i></b> on Telegram about any secret plan
                to attack the Capitol. Instead, many <b>MOSD</b> Proud Boys were still
                <a href="https://sigsegv1980.github.io/j6/ProudBoys-BootsOnTheGroundChat.pdf#page=3">asking <i>basic questions</i></a> about
                what they were even supposed to be doing on Jan 6. 
                Therefore, it's considerably <i>more likely</i> that no conspiracy to storm the Capitol ever existed, and that 
                the <i><b>real</b></i> plan
                for January 6th was, as the actual Telegram evidence <b><i>strongly</i></b> suggests, something <a href="#anc2">much more mundane</a>.

                These Telegram posts are part of the discussion unfolding the evening before January 6th as many <b>MOSD</b>
                Proud Boys were arriving in DC, checking into their hotels, and making plans to meet up socially that night.
                <b>Aaron Wolkin</b> (a.k.a. <b>Aaron Of The Bloody East</b>), a <b>MOSD</b> leader who participated in
                the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9HY3IVStIJc"><b>MOSD Zoom Meeting</b></a> on December 30, 2020,

                Regardless of whether <b>Aaron Wolkind's</b> description of these events was accurate, these Telegram posts
                adds to the large body of Telegram evidence demonstrating that the <b>MOSD</b> Proud Boys were consistently
                focused on the threat of <b>Antifa</b> counter-protesters over and above other concerns, including
                any hypothetical secret plan to storm the Capitol. Throughout the entire body of available Telegram evidence,
                including the Telegram conversations that took place on January 5th or the morning of January 6th itself,
                there was not a <i>single</i> mention of any plan to storm the Capitol and attack the police defending it. Rather,
                the Proud Boys were <i>consistently</i> focused on <b>Antifa</b>.
                <br><br>
                Indeed, the Proud Boys' concerns about <b>Antifa</b> was understandable, because the Proud Boys got into
                violent street battles with <b>Antifa</b> during the two previous
                <b>“Million MAGA March”</b> rallies in DC on

                <br><br>
                This single-minded focus on <b>Antifa</b> continued even throughout the morning of January 6th itself, as
                demonstrated by <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oSOsG5kN5wc"><b>Eddie Block's</b> Jan 6 livestream</a>.
                Documentary filmmaker <b>Eddie Block</b> followed the Proud Boys around the streets of DC throughout the morning of January 6th,
                filming their march in an uninterrupted livestream right up until the Capitol riot broke out in the early afternoon, revealing that the Proud Boys 
                were more concerned with <b>Antifa</b> than anything else. 
                The video shows that the <b>MOSD</b> Proud Boys, led by <b>Ethan Nordean</b>, marched around DC chanting 
                <i>“<a href="https://youtu.be/oSOsG5kN5wc?t=5620"><b>Fuck Antifa!</b></a>”</i> (timestamp <b>1:33:40</b>)
                like they always do at rallies, in order to <i>“<a href="https://youtu.be/oSOsG5kN5wc?t=2711">[let] <b>Antifa</b> know we run this town</a>”</i> (timestamp <b>45:11</b>).

                <i>away</i> from the Capitol <a href="https://youtu.be/oSOsG5kN5wc?t=2361">towards the Library of Congress</a> and the Supreme Court (timestamp <b>39:21</b>),
                before stopping again to hang around for over half an hour <a href="https://youtu.be/oSOsG5kN5wc?t=4257">by the food trucks</a> (timestamp <b>1:10:57</b>)
                parked along Constitution Ave. They then headed 
                <a href="https://youtu.be/oSOsG5kN5wc?t=5409">back towards the Capitol</a> (timestamp <b>1:30:09</b>)
                — while <i>still</i> chanting <i>“<a href="https://youtu.be/oSOsG5kN5wc?t=5620"><b>Fuck Antifa!</b></a>”</i> (timestamp <b>1:33:40</b>) — 
                as they <a href="https://youtu.be/oSOsG5kN5wc?t=5653">followed a crowd</a> of 
                Trump supporters (timestamp <b>1:34:13</b>) who were gathering near the Capitol shortly before the riot began.
                <br><br>
                Surely, if the Proud Boys really had any secret plan to storm the Capitol devised in advance of Jan 6, it would have made much more sense 
                to remain gathered near the Capitol grounds for most of the morning, waiting for an opportunity to incite
                a riot. Instead, the Proud Boys marched around the streets of DC with no obvious itinerary while <a href="https://youtu.be/oSOsG5kN5wc?t=3125">looking for <b>Antifa</b></a>
                (timestamp <b>52:05</b>),
                and they constantly <a href="https://youtu.be/oSOsG5kN5wc?t=4422">talked about <b>Antifa</b></a> (timestamp <b>1:13:42</b>)
                and regularly chanted
                <i>“<a href="https://youtu.be/oSOsG5kN5wc?t=2905"><b>Fuck Antifa!</b></a>”</i> (e.g.

                This strongly suggests that no conspiracy to storm the Capitol ever existed, and that

                On the evening of January 5th, 2021, many of the <b>MOSD</b> Proud Boys arrived in DC and checked into their hotels.

                During the conspiracy trial, the prosecution claimed that the <i>primary</i> purpose of the <b>MOSD</b> chapter was to secretly plan an attack on the Capitol
                to be carried out on January 6th, 
                and that this secret conspiracy began as early as December 20th, 2020. Yet the Telegram post quoted here in the left column,
                and many others like it, make it clear that even on the <i>night before January 6th</i>, many <b>MOSD</b> Proud Boys were still
                asking <i>basic</i> questions about the plan for Jan 6.
                <br><br>
                Some of this confusion could be attributable to <b>Enrique Tarrio's</b> 
                <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20220712213106/https://twitter.com/maustermuhle/status/1346521554855874565">arrest on January 4th</a> 
                for an unrelated crime, which — secret conspiracy or no secret conspiracy — certainly
                <a href="https://sigsegv1980.github.io/j6/ProudBoys-MOSD-MAIN2-2021-1-4_2021-1-5.pdf#page=8">disrupted the Proud Boys' original plans</a> to some extent and 
                caused some confusion. Yet the Telegram evidence suggests a more fundamental lack of advance-planning that extends well beyond
                the scrambling to compensate for <b>Enrique Tarrio</b>'s arrest.
                As the Telegram posts quoted here clearly demonstrate, on 
                the evening before January 6th, some <b>MOSD</b> Proud Boys (including <b>MOSD</b> leaders) clearly had <i>no idea</i> what they were supposed to 
                be doing in DC on Jan 6, while upper-tier <b>MOSD</b> leaders like <b>Joe Biggs</b> seemed to be 
                <a href="https://sigsegv1980.github.io/j6/ProudBoys-BootsOnTheGroundChat.pdf#page=2">formulating a plan on the fly</a>. 
                These Telegram posts aren't necessarily the strongest examples of exculpatory Telegram evidence, but they certainly don't
                lend any support to the prosecution's notion of a secret plan to storm the Capitol that the <b>MOSD</b> leaders had allegedly been 
                discussing and preparing for since December 20th, 2020 or earlier.
                <br><br>
                The fact remains that even on 
                the <i>night before January 6th</i> there was still <b><i>zero discussion</i></b> on Telegram about any secret plan
                to attack the Capitol. Instead, many <b>MOSD</b> Proud Boys were still

                In this Telegram conversation, which took place at around 9:30 PM on the night of January 5th, 2021,
                in the <a href="https://sigsegv1980.github.io/j6/ProudBoys-NewMOSD-2021-1-4_2021-1-13.pdf"><b>New MOSD Leadership</b> group chat</a>,
                <b>Charles Donohoe</b> (a.k.a. <b>YutYut Cowabunga</b>), a high-ranking <b>MOSD</b> leader, seemed
                to <i>still</i> have no idea what the plan for Jan 6 was. <b>Joe Biggs</b>, who earlier that evening
                seemed to be <a href="https://sigsegv1980.github.io/j6/ProudBoys-BootsOnTheGroundChat.pdf#page=2">formulating a plan on the fly</a>,
                told <b>Donohoe</b> that <i>“I gave <b>Enrique</b> a plan. The one I told the guys and he said he had one”</i>.
                <br><br>
                This is one of several Telegram conversations from January 5th and the morning of January 6th itself 
                wherein one of the high-ranking <b>MOSD</b> leaders clearly had very little information about the actual 
                plan for Jan 6. During the conspiracy trial, the prosecution claimed that the <i>primary</i> purpose of the <b>MOSD</b> 
                chapter was to secretly plan an attack on the Capitol
                to be carried out on January 6th, 
                and that this secret conspiracy began on December 20th, 2020 or earlier. Indeed, the prosecution would likely
                interpret any mention on Telegram of a <i>“plan”</i> to be a reference to the <i><b>secret conspiracy</b></i> to storm the Capitol that 
                the <b>MOSD</b> Proud Boys had allegedly been planning since December 20th, 2020.
                <br><br>
                Yet the Telegram posts quoted here in the left column, along with many similar Telegram posts from January 5th and
                the morning of January 6th itself, clearly paint a different picture, suggesting that no such conspiracy
                ever existed and that there was still widespread confusion about the plan <i>less than a day</i> before “show time”.
                <b>Joe Biggs</b>, who again seemed to be <a href="https://sigsegv1980.github.io/j6/ProudBoys-BootsOnTheGroundChat.pdf#page=2">
                formulating a plan on the fly</a> earlier that evening, told <b>Charles Donohoe</b> that he <i>“gave Enrique a plan”</i>. It's not
                entirely clear what <b>Biggs</b> meant here as <b>Enrique Tarrio</b> was out of the picture by this point, but it's clear that 
                whatever <i>“plan”</i> <b>Joe Biggs</b> had was something the other <b>MOSD</b> leaders had no knowledge of and something
                that <b>Joe Biggs</b> had <a href="https://sigsegv1980.github.io/j6/ProudBoys-BootsOnTheGroundChat.pdf#page=2">recently formulated</a> within the last couple of hours. 
                <br><br>
                None of this lends any support to the prosecution's notion of a secret plan to storm the Capitol by inciting
                “normie” supporters to riot — a plan that, according to the prosecution, the <b>MOSD</b> leaders had allegedly been 
                talking about and meticulously preparing for since December 20th, 2020 or earlier.
                <br><br>
                Some of this confusion and last-minute scrambling to formulate a plan for Jan 6 could be attributable to <b>Enrique Tarrio's</b> 
                <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20220712213106/https://twitter.com/maustermuhle/status/1346521554855874565">arrest on January 4th</a> 
                for an unrelated crime, which — secret conspiracy or no secret conspiracy — certainly
                <a href="https://sigsegv1980.github.io/j6/ProudBoys-MOSD-MAIN2-2021-1-4_2021-1-5.pdf#page=8">disrupted the Proud Boys' original plans</a> to 
                some extent and caused 
                some confusion. Yet the Telegram posts quoted here clearly demonstrate a more fundamental lack of advance-planning that extends well beyond
                scrambling to compensate for <b>Enrique Tarrio</b>'s arrest. Indeed, less than
                a day before Jan 6, multiple high-ranking <b>MOSD</b> 
                leaders clearly had <i>no idea</i> what the plan was. It's therefore considerably <i>more likely</i> that no conspiracy to storm the Capitol ever existed, 
                and that the <i><b>real</b></i> original plan
                for January 6th was, as the actual Telegram evidence <b><i>strongly</i></b> indicates, something <a href="#anc2">much more mundane</a>.

                In this Telegram conversation, which took place on the morning of January 6th, less than <i>two hours</i>
                before the Capitol riot began, <b>Aaron Wolkind</b> (a.k.a. <b>Aaron Of The Bloody East</b>), a high-ranking <b>MOSD</b> leader, 
                seemed to <i>still</i> have no idea what the plan for Jan 6 was. Moreover, <b>John Charles Stewart</b> 
                (a.k.a. <b>Johnny Blackbeard</b>), another <b>MOSD</b> leader, warned that groups of Proud Boys
                were splintering off to go do their own thing independently due to a perceived lack of central leadership.
                <br><br>
                This is one of several Telegram conversations from the morning of January 6th or the evening of January 5th
                clearly indicating that many high-ranking <b>MOSD</b> leaders had very little information about the actual 
                plan for Jan 6, while “rank and file” Proud Boys complained about the 
                <a href="https://sigsegv1980.github.io/j6/ProudBoys-BootsOnTheGroundChat.pdf#page=3">lack of a plan and lack of direction
                and leadership</a>. During the conspiracy trial, the prosecution claimed that the <i>primary</i> purpose of the <b>MOSD</b> 
                chapter was to secretly plan an attack on the Capitol building
                to be carried out on January 6th, and that this secret conspiracy began on December 20th, 2020 or earlier. 
                Yet the Telegram posts quoted here clearly paint a different picture, suggesting a lack of any significant
                advance-planning or firm objectives. <b>MOSD</b> leaders clearly <i>still</i> had very little specific information
                about the plan  on the <i>morning of January 6th</i> less than <i>two hours</i> before the Capitol riot began.
                <br><br>
                Moreover, in the Telegram conversation quoted here in the left column, <b>MOSD</b> leader <b>Jeremy Bertino</b> 
                (a.k.a. <b>Noble Beard The Immortal</b>), who was not present in DC on Jan 6, asked fellow <b>MOSD</b> leader
                <b>Zach Rehl</b> <i>“You guys see any, uh, resistance out there, or any <b>Antifa</b> presence?”</i> This is yet another
                piece of Telegram evidence demonstrating the Proud Boys' <a href="#anc28">central focus on <b>Antifa</b></a>, their 
                <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20201213043848/https://www.the-sun.com/news/1959359/million-maga-march-dc-trump-steal-election-stabbing/">long-time
                street rivals</a>, over any other objective. Again, this Telegram conversation occurred less than <i>two hours</i>
                before the Jan 6 riot. And yet nobody asked any questions or made any comments on Telegram pertaining to a
                secret mission to storm the Capitol. Instead, <b>Jeremy Bertino</b>, an upper-tier <b>MOSD</b> leader, asked
                the boys on the ground in DC if they encountered any local <b>Antifa</b> counter-protesters. Meanwhile, the <b>MOSD</b>
                Proud Boys were <a href="https://youtu.be/oSOsG5kN5wc?t=591">marching towards the intersection of 1st Street NW and Constitution Ave</a>, 
                led by <b>Ethan Nordean</b> (a.k.a. <b>Rufio</b>) who directed the march with a megaphone.
                <br><br>
                The prosecution claimed that the <b>MOSD</b> Proud Boys conspired well in advance of January 6th to storm
                the Capitol by inciting a mob of “normie” Trump supporters. If this claim were true, we would expect that
                by 11:20 AM on the morning of January 6th (around when this Telegram conversation occurred) the <b>MOSD</b> Proud Boys
                would have been positioned strategically near the Capitol building awaiting an opportunity to incite a riot.
                Instead, we know from <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oSOsG5kN5wc"><b>Eddie Block's livestream video</b></a> 
                that the <b>MOSD</b> Proud Boys were marching around 
                the streets of DC chanting <i>“<b><a href="https://youtu.be/oSOsG5kN5wc?t=497">Fuck Antifa!</a></b>”</i>,
                while taking <a href="https://youtu.be/oSOsG5kN5wc?t=2051">group photos</a>, 
                and <a href="https://youtu.be/oSOsG5kN5wc?t=2726">mingling with ordinary Trump supporters</a>, like they always do at rallies:

                <b>Zach Rehl</b>, an upper-tier <b>MOSD</b> leader, was marching with <b>Ethan Nordean</b> (a.k.a. <b>Rufio</b>) and the <b>MOSD</b> chapter
                when he posted a voice message on Telegram to answer <b>Jeremy Bertino's</b> question about <b>Antifa</b>. In the
                audio of <b>Zach Rehl's</b> voice message, <b>Ethan Nordean</b> can be heard in the background
                giving orders to the “rank and file” Proud Boys over his megaphone, saying <i>“Right side, right side slow down,
                left side speed up, right side slow down”</i>. This is consistent with <b>Eddie Block's</b> livestream video, which
                recorded this moment (at approximately 11:24 AM on January 6th, 2021) as the <a href="https://youtu.be/oSOsG5kN5wc?t=582">Proud Boys 
                marched towards Constitution Avenue</a> (timestamp <b>9:42</b>).
                <br><br>
                Thus, on the morning of January 6th, less than <i>two hours</i> before the Capitol riot began, the <b>MOSD</b> Proud Boys
                were not doing <i>anything</i> that would suggest they had a secret plan to incite a riot and storm the Capitol.
                Instead, they marched around DC chanting 
                <i>“<a href="https://youtu.be/oSOsG5kN5wc?t=2660"><b>Fuck Antifa!</b></a>”</i> (timestamp <b>44:20</b>)
                in order to <i>“<a href="https://youtu.be/oSOsG5kN5wc?t=2711">[let] <b>Antifa</b> know we run this town</a>”</i> (timestamp <b>45:11</b>).
                The livestream began as the Proud Boys <a href="https://youtu.be/oSOsG5kN5wc?t=311">marched by the Peace Monument</a> (timestamp <b>5:16</b>)
                and then <a href="https://youtu.be/oSOsG5kN5wc?t=634">down Constitution Avenue</a> (timestamp <b>10:34</b>), stopping for a bit by the
                <a href="https://youtu.be/oSOsG5kN5wc?t=1207">east side of the Capitol</a> (timestamp <b>20:07</b>) to <a href="https://youtu.be/oSOsG5kN5wc?t=1353">

                located by the Capitol. The Proud Boys then marched 
                <i>away</i> from the Capitol <a href="https://youtu.be/oSOsG5kN5wc?t=2361">towards the Library of Congress</a> and the Supreme Court (timestamp <b>39:21</b>),
                before stopping again to hang around for over half an hour <a href="https://youtu.be/oSOsG5kN5wc?t=3201">by the food trucks</a> (timestamp <b>53:21</b>) 
                parked along Constitution Ave. 
                Then they headed 
                <a href="https://youtu.be/oSOsG5kN5wc?t=5409">back towards the Capitol</a> (timestamp <b>1:30:09</b>)
                — while <i>still</i> chanting <i>“<a href="https://youtu.be/oSOsG5kN5wc?t=5620"><b>Fuck Antifa!</b></a>”</i> (timestamp <b>1:33:40</b>) — 
                as they <a href="https://youtu.be/oSOsG5kN5wc?t=5653">followed a crowd</a> of 
                Trump supporters (timestamp <b>1:34:13</b>) who were gathering near the Capitol shortly before the riot began.
                <br><br>
                Indeed, much of what the Proud Boys are seen doing throughout <b>Eddie Block's livestream</b>, like marching, 
                <a href="https://youtu.be/oSOsG5kN5wc?t=2051">taking group photos</a>,
                and <a href="https://youtu.be/oSOsG5kN5wc?t=2726">mingling with ordinary Trump supporters</a>, 
                is consistent with what we know of the Proud Boys'
                <a href="https://sigsegv1980.github.io/j6/ProudBoys-EastCoastRallyCommandChat.pdf#page=2"><b>itinerary for an earlier rally</b></a> in DC, 
                which included <b>Enrique Tarrio's</b> mandate to <i>“[W]in hearts and minds. Shake 
                hands kiss babies. Let the people know who the Proud Boys are”</i> and <i>“recruit patriots to join as as we enjoy a march through 
                the streets of DC”</i>. This sort of concern with “public relations” and the Proud Boy “brand” is clearly evident in 
                <b>Eddie Block's</b> Jan 6 livestream video. It's also consistent with the fact that half of the <b>MOSD</b> chapter's upper-tier leadership was 
                <a href="https://sigsegv1980.github.io/j6/ProudBoys-MOSD-MAIN-FullChatMessages-2020-12-27_2021-1-1.pdf#page=194">part of 
                the “<b>Marketing</b>” division</a>.
                <br><br>
                If, as the prosecution claimed, the Proud Boys really had a secret plan to storm the Capitol devised <i>in advance</i> of Jan 6 which they
                had been discussing and preparing for since December 20th, 2020 or earlier, it would have made much more sense 
                for the Proud Boys to remain strategically positioned near the Capitol throughout the morning and early afternoon of Jan 6, waiting for an opportunity to incite
                a riot. Instead, they marched around the streets of DC all morning with no obvious itinerary while <a href="https://youtu.be/oSOsG5kN5wc?t=3125">looking for <b>Antifa</b></a>
                (timestamp <b>52:05</b>),
                and <a href="https://youtu.be/oSOsG5kN5wc?t=4422">talking about <b>Antifa</b></a> (timestamp <b>1:13:42</b>)
                while regularly chanting
                <i>“<a href="https://youtu.be/oSOsG5kN5wc?t=2905"><b>Fuck Antifa!</b></a>”</i> (e.g.

                <br><br>
                The march through the streets of DC and the consistent focus on <b>Antifa</b>  <i>strongly</i> suggests that no secret conspiracy
                to storm the Capitol ever existed. With no secret conspiracy, the Proud Boys would have expected the Jan 6 rally 
                to play out similarly to 
                <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20201118012633/https://www.washingtonpost.com/dc-md-va/2020/11/14/million-maga-march-dc-protests/">earlier rallies</a>, 
                where the primary activity was a 
                <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20201119003724/https://video.parler.com/Vw/KV/VwKViYWJTxob_small.mp4">public march</a> and 
                the primary threat was 
                <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20201213043848/https://www.the-sun.com/news/1959359/million-maga-march-dc-trump-steal-election-stabbing/"><b>Antifa</b> 
                counter-protesters</a>. Indeed, the obsession with <b>Antifa</b> is 
                <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20201128204631/https://twitter.com/BGOnTheScene/status/1332787736575664128">typical for the Proud Boys</a> 
                and reveals that the
                <b>MOSD</b> Proud Boys never had any “bigger” plans for Jan 6 — they were 
                consistently focused on their march and on <b>Antifa</b> 
                right up until the moment when rioters began storming the Capitol in the early afternoon
                of January 6th.
                <br><br>
                This is also consistent with the large body of Telegram evidence strongly suggesting that the Proud Boys' <i><b>true</b></i>
                plan for January 6th was something <i>much</i> more mundane than a secret conspiracy to storm the Capitol: the <i><b>true</b></i> 
                plan was a 
                <i>“<a href="https://sigsegv1980.github.io/j6/ProudBoys-ExportedTelegramChatMOSDOp/messages.html#go_to_message441"><b>simple and quick mission</b></a>”</i> 
                which <b>Enrique Tarrio</b> described as a

                It had absolutely <i>nothing</i> to do with some secret plan to storm the Capitol.

                In this Telegram conversation from around 11:30 AM on January 6th, about an hour and a half before
                the Capitol riot began, <b>MOSD</b> leader <b>Jeremy Bertino</b> (a.k.a. <b>Noble Beard The Immortal</b>),
                who was not in Washington DC at the time, asked fellow <b>MOSD</b> leader <b>Zach Rehl</b>
                (who <i>was</i> in DC marching down Constitution Ave with the other <b>MOSD</b> Proud Boys)
                if the march was attracting any media attention. <b>Charles Donohoe</b>, another <b>MOSD</b>
                leader present in DC, responded by saying <i>“<b>Yeah a lot</b>”</i>.
                <br><br>
                This was something of an understatement. The activity of the <b>MOSD</b> Proud Boys on the morning
                of January 6th was thoroughly documented in an uninterrupted <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oSOsG5kN5wc">livestream by documentary filmmaker
                <b>Eddie Block</b></a>, who filmed the <b>MOSD</b> Proud Boys for about an hour and 40 minutes
                from <b>11:15 AM</b> up until around <b>12:53 PM</b> when the first barricade was breached and the Capitol
                riot began. Moreover, the livestream video reveals that as the Proud Boys marched around the
                streets of DC, they were followed by countless amateur photographers, <a href="https://youtu.be/oSOsG5kN5wc?t=3674">credentialed journalists</a>, and regular citizens
                with cell phones, who tagged along with the <b>MOSD</b> Proud Boys taking photos or videos

                However, the livestream video makes it clear that the <b>MOSD</b> Proud Boys in DC
                made almost <a href="https://youtu.be/oSOsG5kN5wc?t=414">no effort whatsoever</a> to avoid being filmed or photographed. On the contrary, they often

                January 6th, many of the <b>MOSD</b>
                Proud Boys made no effort to conceal their faces, including <b>MOSD</b> leaders <b>Ethan Nordean</b> and <b>Joe Biggs</b>, 
                both of whom marched around DC with their <a href="https://youtu.be/oSOsG5kN5wc?t=1988">faces fully exposed</a> to the cameras.
                <br><br>
                The prosecution claimed that the <b>MOSD</b> Proud Boys conspired well in advance of January 6th to storm
                the Capitol by inciting a mob of “normie” Trump supporters. 
                Yet on the morning of January 6th, throughout the two hours before the Capitol riot began, the <b>MOSD</b> Proud Boys
                were not doing <i>anything</i> to suggest they had some secret plan to incite an insurrection and storm the Capitol. 
                If the prosecution's claims were true, and the <b>MOSD</b> Proud Boys really had a secret plan to attack the Capitol
                which they had been preparing for in secret since December 20th, 2020 or earlier,
                then surely we would expect that by <b>11:30 AM</b> on the morning of January 6th, the <b>MOSD</b> Proud Boys
                would have positioned themselves strategically near the Capitol building while avoiding cameras or concealing
                their identities, as they awaited an opportunity to incite the riot. But instead, the livestream reveals that
                from <b>11:15 AM</b> up until around <b>12:53 PM</b> when the riot began, the Proud Boys marched around
                the streets of DC with their <a href="https://youtu.be/oSOsG5kN5wc?t=2924">faces exposed</a> to countless cameras, as they took 
                <a href="https://youtu.be/oSOsG5kN5wc?t=2051">group photos</a>, 
                <a href="https://youtu.be/oSOsG5kN5wc?t=2726">mingled with ordinary Trump supporters</a>,
                and chanted things like <i>“<a href="https://youtu.be/oSOsG5kN5wc?t=2660"><b>Fuck Antifa!</b></a>”</i> (timestamp <b>44:20</b>).
                <br><br>
                Indeed, much of what the Proud Boys are seen doing throughout <b>Eddie Block's livestream</b>
                is consistent with what we know of the Proud Boys'

                the streets of DC”</i>. This sort of concern with “public relations” and the Proud Boy “brand” is clearly evident in 
                <b>Eddie Block's</b> Jan 6 livestream video. It's also consistent with the fact that half of the <b>MOSD</b> chapter's upper-tier leadership was

                Indeed, about an hour earlier, <b>Johnny Blackbeard</b> had 
                <a href="https://sigsegv1980.github.io/j6/ProudBoys-NewMOSD-2021-1-4_2021-1-13.pdf#page=25">warned the other <b>MOSD</b> leaders</a> that
                <i>“Guys are starting to take their groups off alone because they cant find leadership”</i>.
                <br><br>
                <b>Johnny Blackbeard</b> blamed this disorganization and lack of clear planning on various <i>“hiccups”</i>,
                including <i>“Enrique being arrested”</i> and some of the <b>MOSD</b> leaders being unable to attend the Jan 6 rally.
                <b>Johnny Blackbeard</b> suggested doing an <b>AAR</b> (<b>After Action Report</b>) to figure out
                what went wrong, and recommended <i>“[letting] the guys speak”</i>, giving
                them a chance to <i>“talk about what went well and what didn’t go well”</i> so that
                <i>“we can make adjustments for the next time”</i>.
                <br><br>
                <b>Johnny Blackbeard</b> also emphasized that the Jan 6 rally <i>“was the first one”</i>,
                meaning the first rally the Proud Boys attended under the new <b>MOSD</b> chapter, implying that
                some hiccups were to be expected but that things would surely improve at future rallies.
                <br><br>
                At this point in the early afternoon of January 6th, <b>Johnny Blackbeard</b> seemed to have mostly given up on the Jan 6 rally, ending his 
                message by telling the other <b>MOSD</b> leaders: <i>“You guys are doing the best you

                </div>
                Recall that during the conspiracy trial, the prosecution claimed that the Proud Boys created the <b>MOSD</b> chapter
                <i>specifically</i> to plan an attack on the Capitol building and the police defending it, and 
                came to DC on Jan 6 <i>specifically</i> to carry out this attack which, according to the prosecution, the Proud
                Boys had been preparing for since December 20th, 2020 or earlier. The prosecution further claimed that this
                secret plan entailed inciting a mob of “normie” Trump supporters to attack the police and storm the Capitol
                building.
                <br><br>
                Yet clearly, <b>Johnny Blackbeard</b>'s messages here
                hardly support the prosecution's notion of a secret conspiracy to attack the Capitol.
                Indeed, asking for feedback to identify <i>“what didn’t go so well”</i> while promising to <i>“make adjustments”</i>
                for <i>“the next time”</i> and encouraging everyone to <i>“keep your head up”</i> and to <i>“<b>have a good time</b>”</i>, 
                hardly seems like the behavior of someone conspiring to orchestrate a <i>full-frontal assault</i>
                on the US Capitol followed by an intense, potentially <i>life-altering</i> siege and 
                occupation intended to forcefully overturn the results of a Presidential election. Rather, <b>Johnny Blackbeard</b>'s
                messages here sound more like a high-school football coach trying to encourage an under-performing team. 
                At the very least, these messages do not reflect the mindset of someone expecting a large-scale riot to
                erupt in the next 40 minutes. 
                <br><br>
                Additionally, <b>Johnny Blackbeard</b> attributed some of the perceived shortcomings in
                planning and organization to a lack of manpower, explaining that the few <b>MOSD</b> leaders currently on the ground 
                in DC were trying to do both <i>“leadership and marketing at the same time”</i>. However, <i>“<b>leadership and marketing</b>”</i>
                hardly seems applicable to a secret conspiracy to storm the Capitol, but it
                <i><b>does</b></i> apply nicely to <b>Enrique Tarrio</b>'s  
                <a href="https://sigsegv1980.github.io/j6/ProudBoys-EastCoastRallyCommandChat.pdf#page=2"><b>itinerary</b> for an earlier rally</a> 
                where he instructed the Proud Boys to <i>“Win hearts and minds. Shake hands kiss babies. Let the people know who the Proud Boys are”</i>.
                <br><br>
                Indeed, as we know from <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oSOsG5kN5wc"><b>Eddie Block's Jan 6 livestream video</b></a>, 
                <i>“[winning] hearts and minds”</i> is an apt description of the sort 
                of “public relations” activity the <b>MOSD</b> Proud Boys
                engaged in on the morning of January 6th as they <a href="https://youtu.be/oSOsG5kN5wc?t=1383">mingled with ordinary Trump supporters attending 
                the rally</a>.
                This is also consistent with the fact that half of the <b>MOSD</b> chapter's upper-tier leadership was 
                <a href="https://sigsegv1980.github.io/j6/ProudBoys-MOSD-MAIN-FullChatMessages-2020-12-27_2021-1-1.pdf#page=194">part of

                In this Telegram conversation which occurred less than <i>one hour</i> before the Capitol riot began,
                a <b>MOSD</b> Proud Boy using the Telegram handle “<b>Do you want total war</b>” seemed to have
                lost patience with the <b>MOSD</b> leadership's poor planning or lack of direction. On the morning
                of January 6th, several Proud Boys clearly had <a href="https://sigsegv1980.github.io/j6/ProudBoys-NewMOSD-2021-1-4_2021-1-13.pdf#page=25">very 
                little information about the plan</a> for
                Jan 6. <b>MOSD</b> leader <b>John Charles Stewart</b> (<b>Johnny Blackbeard</b>) 
                <a href="https://sigsegv1980.github.io/j6/ProudBoys-NewMOSD-2021-1-4_2021-1-13.pdf#page=25">warned the other
                <b>MOSD</b> leaders</a> that <i>“Guys are starting to take their groups off alone because they cant find leadership”</i>.
                <br><br>
                In the Telegram conversation quoted here in the left column we have an example of what <b>Johnny Blackbeard</b>
                was worried about. One of the “rank and file” Proud Boys seemed flippant towards the plan for Jan 6, 
                dismissing it as <i>“<b>[A] mirror of the 12th. Exact same plan</b>”</i>. The <i>“12th”</i> refers to December 12th, 2020,
                the date of the second “<a href="https://nypost.com/2020/12/12/proud-boys-anti-trump-protesters-tangle-in-dc-as-daytime-rallies-end/"><b>Million MAGA March</b></a>” 
                rally in DC, which the Proud Boys also attended. The plan for this earlier rally in December was
                described in an <a href="https://sigsegv1980.github.io/j6/ProudBoys-EastCoastRallyCommandChat.pdf#page=2"><b>itinerary</b> posted on Telegram</a> 
                by <b>Enrique Tarrio</b>. The itinerary included an early afternoon march from 
                <a href="https://sigsegv1980.github.io/j6/CindyChafian-December12PermitForWomenForAmericaFirst.pdf"><b>Freedom Plaza</b> to the Supreme Court</a>.
                This was a different route than the Jan 6 marching route, which centered around
                <b>Capitol Hill</b> and Constitution Ave rather than <b>Freedom Plaza</b> (since many of the 
                <a href="https://sigsegv1980.github.io/j6/Jan6MAGARallyMapGuideFull.pdf"><b>official events</b> for Jan 6</a> were located
                near the Capitol), and <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oSOsG5kN5wc">seemed more aimless</a> in general. However, the Proud Boy 
                using the Telegram handle “<b>Do you want total war</b>” 
                obviously found the itinerary for Jan 6 similar enough to the itinerary for December 12 to
                warrant calling Jan 6 <i>“a mirror of the 12th”</i>.
                <br><br>
                The Proud Boy named “<b>Do you want total war</b>” clearly grew bored or impatient with the <b>MOSD</b> leadership's plan for Jan 6, and
                decided to break away from the <b>MOSD</b> Proud Boys and head off with his chapter to some other location to march 
                independently. 
                <br><br>
                But recall that during the conspiracy trial, the prosecution claimed that the Proud Boys created the <b>MOSD</b> chapter
                <i>specifically</i> to plan an attack on the Capitol building, and 
                futhermore, that the Proud Boys came to DC on Jan 6 <i>specifically</i> to carry out this attack. Clearly, a secret plan to storm
                the Capitol is an <i>entirely different</i> plan than the itinerary for the previous MAGA rally in December,
                which entailed a simple daytime march. Surely, nobody would ever call a secret plan to storm
                the Capitol a <i>“mirror of the 12th”</i> or the <i>“exact same plan [as the 12th]”</i>. Yet
                the Proud Boy named “<b>Do you want total war</b>” clearly believed the plan for Jan 6 was very similar
                to the plan for December 12th. This suggests there was never any secret plan to storm the Capitol building,
                and the plan for Jan 6 involved something mundane like a simple daytime march.
                <br><br>
                Furthermore, a plan to storm the Capitol building
                would only benefit from additional manpower and the <b>MOSD</b> Proud Boys were already
                <a href="https://sigsegv1980.github.io/j6/ProudBoys-NewMOSD-2021-1-4_2021-1-13.pdf#page=34">somewhat understaffed</a>.
                Thus, if they <i>really</i> had a secret plan to storm the Capitol,
                it's quite surprising that none of the <b>MOSD</b> leaders tried to convince “<b>Do you want total war</b>” to stick
                around and help execute the plan. When “<b>Do you want total war</b>” announced that he left
                to go eat with his chapter elsewhere, I would have expected <b>MOSD</b> leader <b>Jeremy Bertino</b>
                to try to convince him to stay and help storm the Capitol. Instead, <b>Jeremy Bertino</b> simply asked him
                <i>“Not watching Trump?”</i>. Then after “<b>Do you want total war</b>” responded, saying
                <i>“No. We decided to march like miles away”</i>, neither <b>Jeremy Bertino</b> nor any of the other <b>MOSD</b>
                leaders seemed to care.
                <br><br>
                Therefore, the Telegram conversation quoted here strongly suggests that no secret conspiracy to storm the Capitol ever existed, and
                that the Proud Boys' <i><b>true</b></i> plan for January 6th was rather mundane and similar to the 
                <a href="https://sigsegv1980.github.io/j6/ProudBoys-EastCoastRallyCommandChat.pdf#page=2">itinerary for the earlier rally</a>
                held on December 12th, 2020.

                This is one of the strongest examples of exculpatory evidence because it directly and
                <i><b>decisively</b></i> refutes the prosecution's entire conspiracy case. It is one
                of several Telegram posts (posted on the day of Jan 6 in a private Telegram group chat the Proud Boys believed to be
                secure) wherein a <b>MOSD</b> Proud Boy <b><i>explicitly</i></b> says that there was <i><b>no advance-planning</i></b>
                to storm the Capitol. It's also worth pointing out that the <i><b>crucial exculpatory post</b></i> in this conversation
                was <a href="https://sigsegv1980.github.io/j6/ProudBoys-BootsOnTheGroundChat.pdf#page=12"><b>conveniently omitted</b> from the actual
                Government Exhibit</a> (on page 12 of the PDF), and therefore had to be discovered buried in
                another court filing (which I've incorporated as <a href="https://sigsegv1980.github.io/j6/ProudBoys-BootsOnTheGroundChat.pdf#page=13">page 13 of the PDF</a>).
                <br><br>
                In this Telegram conversation, which occurred in the late afternoon of January 6th as the Capitol riot was in progress,
                <b>MOSD</b> leader <b>Charles Donohoe</b> (a.k.a. <b>YutYut Cowabunga</b>) posted a news
                update from “Disclose TV”, reporting that President Trump ordered the deployment of National Guard troops to help
                quell the unfolding Capitol riot. <b>Charles Donohoe</b> commented on this, saying <i>“Trump ordering National Guard to attack...
                Trump supporters?”</i>. In response, “<b>Matthew The People's Chairman Walter</b>”, another <b>MOSD</b> Proud Boy, 
                said <i>“Ummm <b>I don't think the plan was to attacked, damage, and attempt to control government building</b>.
                I believe Trump is saying FAFO [i.e. Fuck Around And Find Out]”</i>.
                <br><br>
                Because this sort of evidence (of which there are several additional examples listed below) is
                <b><i>so decisively exculpatory</i></b>, there were very few ways the prosecution could have effectively countered it directly.
                One way would be to suggest that the Proud Boys were purposely posting statements like this
                on Telegram, denying the Capitol riot was planned in advance, in order to mislead some hypothetical future FBI 
                digital forensic examiner reading these private Telegram chats. But of course, there is absolutely <i>zero</i> evidence 
                this is the case. The Telegram evidence reveals that the Proud Boys only began to worry about the possibility of 
                law enforcement reading their private chats <i>after</i> something happened to give them reason to believe
                their security was compromised. For example, after 
                <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20220712213106/https://twitter.com/maustermuhle/status/1346521554855874565"><b>Enrique Tarrio</b> was arrested</a> 
                on January 4th, 2021, they deleted the original <b>MOSD</b> Telegram group chats and replaced them with
                new group chats (e.g. <a href="https://sigsegv1980.github.io/j6/ProudBoys-MOSDChat-2020-12-20_2021-1-4.pdf"><b>MOSD</b></a> was replaced 
                with <a href="https://sigsegv1980.github.io/j6/ProudBoys-NewMOSD-2021-1-4_2021-1-13.pdf"><b>New MOSD</b></a>, 
                and <a href="https://sigsegv1980.github.io/j6/ProudBoys-MOSD-Main-2020-12-27_2021-1-4.pdf"><b>MOSD MAIN</b></a> was replaced with
                <a href="https://sigsegv1980.github.io/j6/ProudBoys-MOSD-MAIN2-2021-1-4_2021-1-5.pdf"><b>MOSD MAIN 2</b></a>.)
                However, the group chats created after January 4th, including the 
                <a href="https://sigsegv1980.github.io/j6/ProudBoys-BootsOnTheGroundChat.pdf"><b>Boots On The Ground</b></a> group chat
                wherein this Telegram conversation occurred, were considered by the Proud Boys to be secure until
                January 7th, 2021, at the earliest, when some 
                Proud Boys first <a href="https://sigsegv1980.github.io/j6/ProudBoys-BootsOnTheGroundChat.pdf#page=7">became aware that the FBI was 
                now actively hunting down</a> individuals who participated in the Capitol riot.
                And it wasn't until January 8th
                that the <b>MOSD</b> leadership began to <a href="https://sigsegv1980.github.io/j6/ProudBoys-NewMOSD-2021-1-4_2021-1-13.pdf#page=35">actively worry about 
                what they posted on Telegram</a>.
                <br><br>
                Indeed, prior to this, the Proud Boys clearly believed their Telegram group chats were secure, and regularly posted <i>highly incriminating</i>
                messages in these Telegram group chats, including plans to
                <a href="https://sigsegv1980.github.io/j6/ProudBoys-ExportedTelegramChatMOSDOp/messages.html#go_to_message533">illegally bring a concealed knife</a>
                to Washington DC. In fact, <b>MOSD</b> leader <b>Jeremy Bertino</b> posted 
                <i>“<a href="https://sigsegv1980.github.io/j6/ProudBoys-BootsOnTheGroundChat.pdf#page=10">Storming the capital 
                building right now!!</a>”</i> on the day of January 6th itself as the Capitol riot was in progress. Clearly,
                the <b>MOSD</b> leadership saw no reason to obfuscate or hide their Telegram chats on the day of January 6th itself. And of course,
                the prosecution's <i>entire <a href="https://sigsegv1980.github.io/j6/2022-06-06-USAvEthanNordeanAndJosephBiggsAndZacharyRehlAndEnriqueTarrioAndDominicPezzola-ThirdSupersedingIndictment.pdf">
                <b>seditious conspiracy</b></i> case</a> was based primarily on incriminating Telegram posts,
                so for the prosecution to arbitrarily declare that certain <b><i>exculpatory</i></b> posts are somehow disingenuous would amount to
                cherry-picking.
                <br><br>
                Therefore, there are no grounds for interpreting these Telegram posts as anything but <i>authentic</i> reactions, and
                the post here from <b>MOSD</b> Proud Boy “<b>Matthew The People's Chairman Walter</b>” seriously undermines the prosecution's 
                entire conspiracy case.
                <br><br>
                Alternatively, the prosecution could argue that the Proud Boy using the Telegram handle “<b>Matthew The People's Chairman Walter</b>”
                genuinely <i>didn't</i> know about the secret plan to storm the Capitol, because he was not “in the loop” and
                therefore was never informed about the secret conspiracy by the <b>MOSD</b> leadership. In this version of the prosecution's
                conspiracy theory, the “rank and file” Proud Boys were <i>never</i> informed about the <i><b>real</b></i> plan —
                even on the day of Jan 6 itself. However, this counter-argument is still insufficient to refute the exculpatory Telegram evidence,
                because there are <i>also</i> Telegram posts from upper-tier <b>MOSD</b> leaders (see below) that directly deny the
                Capitol riot was planned in advance.

                exculpatory evidence because it directly and
                <i><b>decisively</b></i> refutes the prosecution's entire conspiracy case. In this post, <b>Zach Rehl</b> (a.k.a. <b>Captain Trump</b>),
                an <i>upper-tier</i> <b>MOSD</b> leader, explicitly said that he did <i><b>NOT</i></b> expect the Capitol riot to occur. 
                This refutes the entire premise that the attack on the Capitol was planned in advance. 
                <br><br>
                This Telegram evidence is
                <b><i>so decisively exculpatory</i></b> that there were very few ways the prosecution could have effectively countered it directly.
                One way would be to suggest that <b>Zach Rehl</b> was not expressing his true belief here, but rather purposely posting 
                a deceptive statement in order to mislead some hypothetical future FBI 
                digital forensic examiner reading these private Telegram chats. But of course, there is absolutely <i>zero</i> evidence 
                this is the case. Rather, the Telegram evidence reveals that the Proud Boys only began to worry about the possibility of 
                law enforcement reading their private chats <i>after</i> something happened to give them a <i>specific reason</i> to believe
                their security was compromised. For example, after 
                <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20220712213106/https://twitter.com/maustermuhle/status/1346521554855874565"><b>Enrique Tarrio</b> was arrested</a> 
                on January 4th, 2021, the <b>MOSD</b> Proud Boys deleted the original <b>MOSD</b> Telegram group chats and replaced them with
                new group chats (e.g. <a href="https://sigsegv1980.github.io/j6/ProudBoys-MOSDChat-2020-12-20_2021-1-4.pdf"><b>MOSD</b></a> was replaced 
                with <a href="https://sigsegv1980.github.io/j6/ProudBoys-NewMOSD-2021-1-4_2021-1-13.pdf"><b>New MOSD</b></a>, 
                and <a href="https://sigsegv1980.github.io/j6/ProudBoys-MOSD-Main-2020-12-27_2021-1-4.pdf"><b>MOSD MAIN</b></a> was replaced with
                <a href="https://sigsegv1980.github.io/j6/ProudBoys-MOSD-MAIN2-2021-1-4_2021-1-5.pdf"><b>MOSD MAIN 2</b></a>.)
                However, the group chats created after January 4th, including the 
                <a href="https://sigsegv1980.github.io/j6/ProudBoys-BootsOnTheGroundChat.pdf"><b>Boots On The Ground</b></a> group chat
                wherein this Telegram conversation occurred, were considered by the Proud Boys to be secure until
                January 7th, 2021, at the earliest, when some
                Proud Boys <a href="https://sigsegv1980.github.io/j6/ProudBoys-BootsOnTheGroundChat.pdf#page=16">became aware that the FBI was 
                now actively hunting down</a> individuals who participated in the Capitol riot. And it wasn't until January 8th
                that the <b>MOSD</b> leadership began to <a href="https://sigsegv1980.github.io/j6/ProudBoys-NewMOSD-2021-1-4_2021-1-13.pdf#page=35">actively worry about 
                what they posted on Telegram</a>.
                <br><br>
                Indeed, prior to this, the Proud Boys clearly believed their Telegram group chats were secure, and regularly posted <i>highly incriminating</i>
                messages in these Telegram group chats, including plans to
                <a href="https://sigsegv1980.github.io/j6/ProudBoys-ExportedTelegramChatMOSDOp/messages.html#go_to_message533">illegally bring a concealed knife</a>
                to Washington DC. In fact, <b>MOSD</b> leader <b>Jeremy Bertino</b> posted 
                <i>“<a href="https://sigsegv1980.github.io/j6/ProudBoys-BootsOnTheGroundChat.pdf#page=10">Storming the capital 
                building right now!!</a>”</i> on the day of January 6th itself as the Capitol riot was in progress,
                along with other <a href="https://sigsegv1980.github.io/j6/ProudBoys-NewMOSD-2021-1-4_2021-1-13.pdf#page=32">inflammatory statements celebrating the storming of the Capitol</a>. 
                Clearly,
                the <b>MOSD</b> leadership saw no reason to obfuscate or hide their Telegram chats on the day of January 6th itself. And of course,
                the prosecution's <i>entire <a href="https://sigsegv1980.github.io/j6/2022-06-06-USAvEthanNordeanAndJosephBiggsAndZacharyRehlAndEnriqueTarrioAndDominicPezzola-ThirdSupersedingIndictment.pdf">
                <b>seditious conspiracy</b></i> case</a> was based primarily on incriminating Telegram posts,
                so for the prosecution to arbitrarily declare that certain <b><i>exculpatory</i></b> Telegram posts are somehow disingenuous would amount to
                flagrant cherry-picking.
                <br><br>
                Therefore, there are no grounds for interpreting <b>Zach Rehl</b>'s Telegram post as anything but <i>authentic</i>, and
                <b>Zach Rehl</b>'s post here seriously undermines the prosecution's 
                entire conspiracy case.
                <br><br>
                Finally, it's interesting to note the irony in <b>Zach Rehl</b>'s Telegram post. <b>Zach Rehl</b> clearly indicated
                that the Capitol riot was an <i>unexpected</i> event from his perspective, but he 
                attributed the <i>root cause</i> of the riot to <i>“us showing up and 
                starting some chants and getting the normies all riled up”</i>. 
                This statement <i>partially</i>
                validated the prosecution's theory about the <i>mechanism</i> behind the Jan 6 riot.
                The prosecution argued that the
                Proud Boys conspired (in advance of Jan 6) to orchestrate an attack on the Capitol building by
                “riling up the normies”, i.e. inciting a mob of ordinary Trump supporters to riot. Thus,
                the prosecution might have been correct that the incessant chanting from a group of Proud Boys 
                was the initial spark that ignited the riot. However, the Proud Boys <i>often</i> 
                <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20201203011052/https://twitter.com/BGOnTheScene/status/1334303980390912002">chanted
                at rallies</a> and <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20201120085317/https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7H9pQB6bGrU">led crowds to chant</a>
                along with them, so their chants near the barricade on January 6th were nothing out of the ordinary.
                Moreover, <b>Zach Rehl</b>'s Telegram post (along with a large body of other exculpatory evidence) 
                demonstrates fairly conclusively that the 
                chanting was not <i>intended specifically</i> to incite a riot that would result in an attack on the Capitol.
                But of course it's certainly possible that this chanting 
                was one of the factors
                that contributed to the spontaneous outbreak of a riot.
                <br><br>
                In a follow-up Telegram post,
                <b>Zach Rehl</b> posted a 
                <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20210107122229/https://video.parler.com/is/FB/isFBig9w0I3Q_small.mp4">

                breached the outer barricade, allowing the riotous mob to approach the Capitol building.

                providing further evidence
                that the Proud Boys were not yet taking serious precautions to conceal what they did on January 6th. Thus,

                <b>Bertino</b> agreed with <b>Donohoe's</b> point about the small number of <b>MOSD</b> Proud Boys

                gonna have a lot of guys on the ground this time</a>”</i>. Thus, many statements in this conversation are
                corroborated by other evidence, further establishing that the Proud Boys
                were expressing genuine beliefs here.

                This Telegram conversation is potentially one of the <i>strongest</i> examples of 
                exculpatory evidence because it <i><b>directly</b></i> refutes the prosecution's entire conspiracy case. In this conversation, 
                <b>MOSD</b> leader <b>Zach Rehl</b> (a.k.a. <b>Captain Trump</b>) posted a link to an FBI affidavit accusing <b>Joseph Biggs</b>
                of conspiring to pre-plan the Capitol riot in advance of January 6th. <b>Zach Rehl</b> commented on the affidavit,
                clearly expressing his firm belief that the Capitol riot was spontaneous and there was no pre-planning involved. <b>Ethan Nordean</b> (a.k.a. <b>Rufio</b>), another 
                upper-tier <b>MOSD</b> leader, chimed in to express surprise over the FBI's claim, and to express agreement with <b>Zach Rehl</b>.
                <br><br>
                At face value, this conversation refutes the prosecution's entire premise that the Capitol attack was planned in advance. 
                However, I do not consider this bit of Telegram evidence to be quite as <b><i>strongly exculpatory</i></b> as similar Telegram
                posts wherein a <b>MOSD</b> leader <a href="#anc41">directly indicated that the <b>Capitol attack was spontaneous</b></a> rather than pre-planned.
                This is because the Telegram discussion quoted here occurred on January 20th, 2021, almost two weeks after the Proud Boys became aware
                that the FBI was <a href="https://sigsegv1980.github.io/j6/ProudBoys-NewMOSD-2021-1-4_2021-1-13.pdf#page=35">aggressively hunting down individuals who
                participated in the Jan 6 riot</a>.
                <br><br>
                Therefore, unlike <a href="https://sigsegv1980.github.io/j6/ProudBoys-BootsOnTheGroundChat.pdf#page=14"><b>similarly exculpatory statements dating to January 6th itself</b></a>, 
                this particular snippet of Telegram evidence 
                quoted here is vulnerable to the counter-argument
                that the Proud Boys were intentionally posting statements on Telegram denying that the Capitol riot was planned in advance, in order to 
                mislead any hypothetical FBI 
                digital forensic examiner who might have been reading their private Telegram chats. Of course, there is no
                evidence to directly support such a claim. 
                Regardless, I have included this statement here as an example of exculpatory evidence. I leave it up to
                the reader to decide whether or not these statements reflected the genuine, authentic beliefs of <b>Zach Rehl</b> and <b>Ethan Nordean</b>.
