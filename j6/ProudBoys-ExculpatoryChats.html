        <h2>Background</h2>
        <br>
        5 members of the <b>Proud Boys</b> were 
        <a href="https://sigsegv1980.github.io/j6/2022-06-06-USAvEthanNordeanAndJosephBiggsAndZacharyRehlAndEnriqueTarrioAndDominicPezzola-ThirdSupersedingIndictment.pdf">
        charged with <b>seditious conspiracy</b></a> for their role in the January 6, 2021 attack on the US Capitol building. 
        Prosecutors claimed that <b>Enrique Tarrio</b>, the leader and chairman of the Proud Boys at the time, conspired
        with <b>Ethan Nordean</b>, <b>Joseph Biggs</b>, <b>Zachary Rehl</b>, and <b>Dominic Pezzola</b>, to storm the
        US Capitol building for the purpose of overturning the 2020 election results, by riling up a large crowd of "normie"
        pro-Trump protesters and using them as a battering ram to breach police defensive lines and occupy the Capitol
        building. The defense acknowledged that some <b>Proud Boys</b> participated in the Capitol riot on January 6, but denied 
        that the defendants actually <i>planned</i> in advance of January 6 to storm the Capitol.
        <br><br>
        The evidence presented by the prosecution to support the <b>seditious conspiracy</b> charges included video footage from January 6, 
        but focused primarily around online activity (mostly Telegram and Parler posts) demonstrating that the Proud Boys made statements 
        that could be interpreted as incriminating evidence of planning in advance to storm the Capitol. The prosecution filed 
        <a href="https://sigsegv1980.github.io/j6/2022-06-06-USAvEthanNordeanAndJosephBiggsAndZacharyRehlAndEnriqueTarrioAndDominicPezzola-ThirdSupersedingIndictment.pdf">
        <b>an indictment</b></a>
        against the 5 Proud Boy conspirators that listed incriminating Telegram and Parler messages in support of the <b>seditious conspiracy</b>
        charges. All of the defendants, except <b>Dominic Pezzola</b>, were found guilty of <b>seditious conspiracy</b> and 
        <a href="https://sigsegv1980.github.io/j6/2023-09-15-USAvEnriqueTarrio-Judgment.pdf">sentenced to at least 15 years</a>
        in prison. I review all of the <a href="https://sigsegv1980.github.io/j6/ProudBoys-IncriminatingChats.html">
        <b>incriminating Telegram and Parler evidence</b></a> in a companion piece to this webpage.
        <br><br>
        I take the position that the <b>seditious conspiracy</b> charges were <b><i>largely baseless</i></b>, and <b>all 5 defendants should
        have been acquitted</b> of that charge due to reasonable doubt.  There is no doubt that some <b>Proud Boys</b> participated in the Capitol riot on 
        January 6 and <i>enthusiastically</i> supported and praised the Jan 6 rioters. But the prosecution's evidence that the Proud Boys actually planned in 
        advance to storm the Capitol is <a href="https://sigsegv1980.github.io/j6/ProudBoys-IncriminatingChats.html">
        incredibly weak and unconvincing</a>. Additionally, there is a large body of <b>exculpatory evidence</b> 
        (evidence suggesting a <b>not guilty</b> verdict)
        found among the Telegram and Parler data in evidence. Here, I go over the most compelling examples of such <b>exculpatory evidence</b>.
        Most of the relevant evidence is available publicly. I have provided a convenient summary of the available sources of trial evidence, and 
        I encourage readers to examine the raw trial evidence and reach their own conclusions.

        <h2>Sources Of Evidence (so you can reach your own conclusion)</h2>
        <br>
        The trial evidence mostly centered around Telegram and Parler messages from the defendants, particularly the Telegram messages
        from private group chats affiliated with a chapter of the <b>Proud Boys</b> called <b><i>“The Ministry of Self Defense” (MOSD)</b></i>. As an organization,
        the <b>Proud Boys</b> (<a href="https://sigsegv1980.github.io/j6/ProudBoysConstitutionAndBylaws.pdf">Proud Boys International, L.L.C.</a>)
        were divided into several <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20201126161545/https://proudboysusa.com/chapters/">autonomous regional chapters</a>, 
        loosely governed by Chairman <b>Enrique Tarrio</b>. In December of 2020,
        <b>Enrique Tarrio</b> created <b>“The Ministry of Self Defense”</b> as a new, <i>national-level</i> chapter 
        for organizing national events. The prosecution argued that <b>Tarrio</b> established the <b>MOSD</b> chapter specifically for the purpose
        of planning the January 6 insurrection. Therefore, the majority of the prosecution's
        evidence consists of messages pulled from multiple private Telegram chat groups affiliated with the <b>MOSD</b> chapter of the Proud Boys.
        <br><br>
        Most of the relevant evidence is available publicly. Some of it can be found in
        the <b>Government Exhibits</b> filed electronically with <a href="https://pacer.uscourts.gov/"><b>PACER</b></a>, which I have organized into  
        separate PDF files for each Telegram group (linked below). The
        Telegram evidence from Government Exhibits usually consists of excerpts selected by the prosecution that omit most of the surrounding context.
        Fortunately, we also have a more complete record of some Telegram groups thanks to 
        <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20220827161137/https://t.me/helpstophate/5468"><b><i>leaked documents</i></b></a> (authenticated

        Telegram chat history recovered by the FBI using forensic software called <a href="https://cellebrite.com/en/home/"><b>Cellebrite</b></a>. Finally,

        The analysis is organized in a 3 column layout. The <b>left-most</b> column shows the

                In this Telegram exchange, <b>John Charles Stewart</b> (<b>Johnny Blackbeard</b>) asks Proud Boy Chairman <b>Enrique Tarrio</b>
                if the <b>“Ministry Of Self Defense” (MOSD)</b> Proud Boys will be traveling to Washington DC as a group on January 6, 2021. The prosecution claimed that 
                the Proud Boys attended the January 6 rally in DC specifically for the purpose of storming the Capitol.
                Yet here, <b>Johnny Blackbeard</b> alludes to something he expects to happen on January 6 that he calls <b><i>“the after party”</i></b>. The prosecution
                would likely interpret <b><i>“the after party”</i></b> as a veiled allusion to a secret plan to storm the Capitol.
                <br><br>
                Of course,
                an <b><i>“after party”</i></b> generally describes a <b>night-time</b> event, yet the Jan 6 Capitol riot began in the afternoon while
                the “main event” (President Trump's speech at the Ellipse) was still in progress. Moreover, 
                the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20201212185503/https://www.nbcwashington.com/news/trump-supporters-protest-in-dc-crowds-gather-at-freedom-plaza/2475292/">
                history of Proud Boy rallies</a>
                informs us that <b><i>“the after party”</i></b> almost
                certainly alludes to the anticipated street fights with <b>anti-fascist counter-protesters</b>
                (a.k.a. <b>“Antifa”</b>) the Proud Boys believed would occur after dark on the streets of DC on January 6. This is exactly what happened during the two previous
                <b>“Million MAGA March”</b> rallies in DC on

                This is why, in late December of 2020, the <b>US Park Police</b> released an

                and 12 December 2020 in Washington, DC”</i> and that <i>“we do anticipate street-level confrontation/violence 
                between [the Proud Boys and counter-protesters]”</i>.
                An earlier intelligence briefing from the <b>US Park Police</b> correctly 
                <a href="https://sigsegv1980.github.io/j6/USParkPoliceEventPreBrief-DCProtestsOn9December2020-MillionMAGAMarch-ProudBoysvAntifa.pdf">predicted that violent 
                street fighting would break out during the December 12th rally</a>, warning that the Proud Boys were likely to clash
                with a <i>“radical group ... made up of individuals who self-identify with the <b>Antifa</b> identity”</i>,
                and that <b><i>“it is almost a certainty that violent confrontations will occur between members of opposing groups”</i></b>.

                This prognosis is almost certainly what the <b>Proud Boys</b> themselves
                also believed would happen on January 6, which is why <b>Johnny Blackbeard</b> used the phrase <b><i>“the after party”</i></b>

                clash violently with <b>Antifa</b> counter-protesters</a>
                in the streets. <b>Johnny Blackbeard</b>'s reference to an anticipated <b><i>“after party”</i></b> also highlights the fact that the <b>Proud Boys</b> were

                on January 6, rather than some secret plot to storm the Capitol. This is consistent with a

                Additionally, <b>Enrique Tarrio's</b> response to <b>Johnny Blackbeard</b> is also exculpatory evidence. The prosecution
                argued that <b>Tarrio</b> created the <b>MOSD</b> chapter for the express purpose of planning the Jan 6 insurrection. But multiple
                private statements from <b>Enrique Tarrio</b> reveal the true purpose of the <b>MOSD</b> chapter: to prevent aggressive and undisciplined 
                behavior from “rank-and-file” Proud Boys at national events and to make it easier to control and direct large numbers of Proud Boys while 
                marching in formation:

                such as dividing up into 10 man

                and acting defensively at all times (timestamps <b>7:48</b>, <b>32:03</b>, <b>33:29</b>). These new policies were
                designed to address issues that came up on December 12th, 2020, during the second <b>“Million MAGA March”</b> rally in DC, when
                <b>Enrique Tarrio</b> lost control during a march (see

                The new <b>MOSD</b> chapter was designed to address these issues, and <b>Enrique Tarrio</b> stated on multiple occasions that the purpose of attending the January 6 rally in DC
                was to <b>field test</b> the new <b>MOSD</b> rallying policies. For example, in the 
                <a href="https://sigsegv1980.github.io/j6/ProudBoys-MOSD-MAIN-FullChatMessages-2020-12-27_2021-1-1.pdf"><b>MOSD Main Telegram group chat</b></a>, Tarrio
                stated <b><i>“we are going to be using the 6th as a test”</i></b> and that the <b>MOSD</b> chapter would be
                running <i>“training exercises”</i> during <a href="https://sigsegv1980.github.io/j6/ProudBoys-MOSD-MAIN-FullChatMessages-2020-12-27_2021-1-1.pdf">
                <i>“the 5th at night and 6th throughout the day”</i></a> (see post from 12/28/2020 at 11:25:22 AM).
                This is consistent with <b>Tarrio's</b> statement
                during the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9HY3IVStIJc"><b>MOSD Zoom meeting</b></a> (timestamp <b>17:35</b>) 
                explaining that <i>“As of right now, the plans for the sixth is just to remain as a nucleus”</i>. 
                Essentially, <b>Tarrio</b> wanted to use the Jan 6 rally as an opportunity to <b>test drive the new MOSD</b> chapter by trying to navigate the 
                streets of DC as a cohesive, disciplined, well-oiled infantry, organized into 10 man squads orbiting a single “nucleus”:

                This is why when <b>Johnny Blackbeard</b> asked <b>Enrique Tarrio</b> if the Proud Boys would be attending the rally
                on January 6 <i>“as a group”</i>, <b>Tarrio</b> responded affirmatively, and then added <i>“So let’s get this shit started <b>so we

                as an opportunity to <b>field test</b> the new <b>MOSD</b> rallying policies. There is really no room here for any <i><b>seditious conspiracy</b></i> 
                to attack the Capitol.

                    This chapter will be hand selected
                    members. The purpose is to discourage and
                    remove new fags and aggressive members
                    from attending national events.
                    <br><br>
                    I see this becoming on issue in the future
                    and I believe this is the best compromise
                    we can come up with to hold unruly
                    members accountable at these events.
                    <br><br>
                    Rally boys will always be a thing...we just need to be able

                        The DC trip will consist of two groups. None of which can be in colors.<br><br>
                        1. The first group of guys have been invited to a special chapter within the organization. If you haven't been invited...please be patient. 
                        We are growing the group slowly.<br><br>
                        2. The second group consists of PBs that are just attending the event. You can coordinate with other PBs and do whatever you guys want.   
                        Group 1 and group 2 will not have any interaction with each other on the 5th at night and 6th throughout the day. We are running a training 
                        exercise at those times.<br><br>
                        Group 2 is still expected to conduct themselves as gentlemen and always keep themselves in a self defense mindset at all times.<br><br>  
                        They way we do national rallies will change drastically over the course of the next couple months. After the 6th you will have to be part 
                        of group 1 to attend national events.

                        what is Biggs leadership of exactly ? Who elected him ? This is something i have yet to

                        Watching his video yesterday, well a highlight of it, he is claiming himself and other leaders made the decision to not go in 
                        colors... I was under the impression this was done because
                        DC chapter has requested this and we were honoring this. I personally think showing up out
                        of colors is more dangerous, but! respect the chapters request and the plan here.<br><br>
                        And doesn't this sort of contradict the rest of us being quiet .

                        As far as “investigating” agitators, I think that it is clearly a case by case type situation. Seeing one rainbow shield 
                        wielding larpist screaming my body my choice is clearly a nothing to see here type situation. However, if we have an active 
                        body of scout types prowling and regrouping at different points in a March, we do the same and post watches in critical areas

                        We're gonna break you guys down into ten man squads and you guys are gonna, you guys are
                        gonna be for
                        the most part, we're gonna stay together, but you guys are gonna make sure that you guys — you ten
                        guys — are always
                        together. Um, I don't think as a massive group we should be using markers,
                        identifying markers, right, because those identifying markers are counterproductive to what we're
                        trying to do 
                        at this particular time, right? So you're going to familiarize yourself that night with those 10 people,
                        and those 10 people
                        you're going to roll with together.

                        All right so with the
                        10 man squad, the reason we're picking 10 instead of others is you can count the 10 on your two hands,
                        so if you're that squad leader, you can't, you only count 9, you're fucked up.
                        Um, and... but even with the big nucleus — roll as a nucleus —
                        I suggest, Enrique, that we still put it into 10 man squad, that way we have full 100% accountability,
                        so nobody goes missing.

                        either decide to be with us, or you decide to be with your chapter. And this, and there's no... there's

                        a training exercise, so we could stay as one fucking unit, right.

                        exactly what this is so far, um, so basically you know we all saw what happened, you know, on the 12th
                        in DC. We were really disorganized and there was a lot of problems that kind of came from that disorganization.

                        thing of this is, you know, with a thousand Proud Boys in DC, you know, we were together sometimes,
                        we're all over the place sometimes, but there was no way to control, you know, um, there's no control
                        over that. So hopefully with this, with this new structure in place, what we'll be able to do is, it'll give us the
                        freedom and
                        flexibility to break off into modular elements where you can have smaller teams
                        that can maybe go two blocks over without everybody just following you know, you know, the guys
                        — and now you have 700 guys going, you know, two blocks over, just because they see the guy next to him moving.
                        You know, now
                        we'll have a little bit more
                        control where we can send elements in different directions and different places to do different things
                        and not necessarily in
                        an offensive manner, but just generally speaking, so we can have that that kind of
                        control.

                        something that we all need to talk about, but the escalation of force — obviously we're the ministry is
                        self-defense, so escalation of force isn't going to be to go out and attack. Um, it's going to be
                        more of like a bodyguard system. So obviously we'll be around
                        the marketing team, a.k.a. the dudes that get
                        all the press and stuff like that, and basically be a bodyguard service for the mission that they're trying
                        to accomplish. 
                        <br><br>
                        But that being said, there's also going to be smaller teams that go out and do things
                        like recon and quick reaction force in case somebody gets jammed up in a bind, and also to provide
                        information back to that main element. So as of now, I think we all agree on
                        this with the escalation of force — it's in strictly a defensive mode.
                        Um, unless the threat is so imminent that you believe that your life is in danger. What do you
                        think?

                        just everyone was like uh, hyper on edge um, at that last rally. And you know what we're trying to avoid 
                        by doing this is like that cowboy shit where people are running off, you know like, when we were leaving 
                        the Freedom Plaza, I saw the dudes in the fucking skirts running off fucking down then we had to fucking 
                         chase them down, and it breaks us up, and that's what we're trying to avoid with what we're doing here.

                        Yeah, um, to touch on that subject, staying together is probably like the most important thing. We had so 
                        many fucking people go off on their own. That's one of the — that's actually the biggest problem that we had. 
                        Uh, I spend — and this includes in most rallies, but it's more controllable when it's a smaller group — I spend 
                        most of my time in rallies fucking bringing people back. I'm just fucking corralling everybody, right? 
                        Trying to keep everybody from doing something stupid.
                        <br><br>
                        If there's one dude — there's, there's a thousand of us dude! — like 
                        we could literally fucking stampede over this dude without using our hand and just walk over them and 
                        it's over. So, um, your throttle control is important and listening is really fucking important. Please. So 
                        I can't stress that enough. That's the most important part here, gentlemen.

                        Since this whole chapter is volunteer, I had a thought on how to keep order. I watched a lot of dumb shit 
                        go down in DC where Beard was trying to keep the peace and people were pretty much like “fuck him”. Acting 
                        stupid or putting your bros in danger while performing your duties as part of this chapter should carry severe penalties. 
                        You dont have to be here and if you're gonna be here you are agreeing to act with some honor and dignity.

                        Well, I mean, the main operating theater should be out in front of the House of Representatives.
                        It should be out in front of the Capitol building. That's where the vote is taking place, and
                        all the objections. So we can ignore the rest of these stages and all that shit, and plan
                        the operations base around the front entrance to the Capitol building. Um, I strongly
                        recommend you use the national mall and not Pennsylvania Avenue, though. It's a wide open
                        space, you can see everything coming from all angles.

                        [Transcript of voice message]:
                        I know some of the guys are, they seem to
                        be a little upset but, what I’m hearing is,
                        uh, the Ministry is together – uh, maybe not
                        exactly as we initially planned, but I think
                        Rufio, Joe, and Zach are doing the best they
                        can with the cards that they were dealt. We
                        need to do the AAR and, uh, let the guys
                        speak, and uh they can talk about what
                        went well and what didn’t go well, and, uh,
                        we can make adjustments for the next time.
                        And then, make sure they understand, you
                        know, this was the first one. Uh, we had
                        quite a fucking hiccup thrown in, um, with
                        Enrique being arrested, me being down,
                        Jeremy being down, Aaron not being able to
                        make it, uh-- I think Yut is on the ground as
                        well, I didn’t mean to leave you out of
                        there, Yut. You guys are doing the best you
                        can with the situation that you have, so,
                        let’s just do the AAR and pivot next time, I
                        guess.
